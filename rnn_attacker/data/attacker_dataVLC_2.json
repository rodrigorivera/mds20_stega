{"text": "the summer has been so full of blockbusters and comebacks of films , and not to mention some of the disappointments of those comebacks , that i was woe to find a film i could just sit down and enjoy . < br /><br />in case you do n't want to read further down the page ( there are n't any spoilers ) , i 'll sum it up here : it 's more mature than ella enchanted ( there are some questionably violent parts , plenty of death , and a handful of scenes with a little blood , not for small children ) , but does n't try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds . think of it as a bit more serious , bit more magical princess bride , and you 'll be close . < br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />i am , perhaps , not as prodigious a movie goer as others ... maybe once or twice a month , if i feel active . i 'm also a huge sci - fi / fantasy fan . i get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10 , and this film is the diamond in the rough.<br /><br />by the end here ( august ) , i was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that i averted seeing bourne ultimatum in favor of stardust . having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by transformers for my fiction addiction , the previews of stardust seemed appealing , but i was certainly wary.<br /><br />as many others here , i was utterly surprised . i had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clich\u00e9d from here to breakfast . do n't be fooled , it is most definitely a fairy - tale , and it does indeed have witches , magic , and utterly requires suspension of disbelief ... but the most refreshing thing i found , is that it 's not based on anything i 've seen or read in the past 15 years , and it 's actually a really good movie.<br /><br />((unlike 90 % of the other movies which seem to persistently re - appear like thorns in a side , perhaps a sign that hollywood is running out of ideas ? i could read a book this year , and in two years the movie would be out as another \" epic fantasy tale , the likes of lotr and the rest \" so says the nyt and such and such no doubt.))<br /><br />stardust did n't have me bolted to my seat because of jam - packed action at every turn , nor was i sweating bullets because of plot - hook after plot - hook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom . it did n't even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to what 's happening on screen ( transformers , i 'm looking at you ) . it 's not trying to show off the latest cgi techniques , nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough i could 've figured them out in 3rd grade ( boy i hate those ) . < br /><br />i just ... watched . watched , and enjoyed a refreshingly creative storyline unfold before my eyes . sure , i may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film , but it makes you forget that . it even made my heart twinge at some parts , but the most important aspect i noticed is that i left the theater feeling better than when i 'd gone in.<br /><br />it truly is a gem . after so much slush this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations , this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work i 'd done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my money 's worth.<br /><br />it 's probably not for everyone , but do yourself a favor ; if you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone ( princess bride , black cauldron , the dark crystal , etc . ) then you should really see this movie . this little diamond is finding its way into my dvd collection the moment it hits stores , you can trust me on this.<br /><br />simply wonderful .", "label": 1}
{"text": "the bourne ultimatum is the third and final outing for super - spy jason bourne , a man who is out to kill the people who made him into a killer . the bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics ( ultimatum has an 85/100 on metacritic.com , meaning it 's status is \" universal acclaim ) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing.<br /><br />first , i highly advise you watch the bourne identity and the bourne supremacy , the two fancy - titled prequels to ultimatum . there may be three different movies , but in reality they are all a continuance of one another : missing one leaves you stranded and confused , just like i was . you will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of ultimatum if you missed the first two , but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion.<br /><br />if you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie , you probably had a treat watching bourne take down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him from supremacy . jason bourne is played very well by matt \u0085 damon . damon does nothing to deserve an oscar nod , but his work here is good enough to hold it 's own . bourne 's adventures take place in many different cities ; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times . the agency tracking bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down.<br /><br />i wo n't go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies . however , it would n't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die - hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development . ultimatum would n't have been harmed at all if the story was a little more up front.<br /><br />it seems most people agree that ultimatum was a success of a film : the movie opened to $ 69 million , and -box office total now is up to $ 216 mil- is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since august 3 . it 's the best action movie i 've seen since live free or die hard.<br /><br />good ) damon is solid but not spectacular , very smart movie bad ) story is like many others", "label": 1}

{"text": "ok ok , it might be hard to put the entirety of a man 's life in one film . traditionally therefore , biopics focus on one or two significant parts in the subject 's life . now , byron was a \" my week beats your year \" fellow , which makes selecting parts that are representative even harder . furthermore , just as byron 's poetry is inseparable from his life , the man 's life itself must be seen as a whole . lifting parts out is not only not showing the whole picture , it 's showing a different picture altogether.<br /><br />now , in short my review comes down to this : supposedly , byron was indeed the \" my week beats your year \" prototype , a guy who lived so intensely that he indeed did more in his 15 or so active years than most do in an entire lifetime . true , he had setbacks and was a victim of the time and social setting he lived in - but in the end , this dude is supposed to be the prototype whose life we 'd all want to lead , no ? well , i did not , at any moment , want to live the life depicted in this film . so it gets 3 . not for being so badly done ( which , direction - wise , it more or less was ) , but more importantly for missing the point entirely in a flat plot.<br /><br />some more detail . well , to over simplify things , a byron bio should have two distinct episodes : 1 . post - first europe trip : england and his rise to fame + marriage / 2 . his life abroad . now , the important thing is that the second part should be at least as important as the first . not only was it a lot longer , but the most significant change in byron took place then . furthermore , it 's where he created his best works ( don juan , the vision of judgement etc . - all the stuff that makes him * really * unique in english literature).<br /><br />instead , in this film ( a ) byron 's life never comes across as even remotely entertaining , ( b ) it only gets * worse * after he leaves england . they did two good jobs : first , they started at his return of his europe trip ( though a bit more of the actual trip would have been welcome as a prologue ) , second , they chose an angle , and they chose his incestuous love for augusta ( who is rather perfectly cast ) . the problem with this last thing is that they never let it go . true , byron remained strongly attached to augusta for the rest of his life , but , especially as he was such a mood swing person , the fact that his letters reflect that does not mean that at other times he might not have completely enjoyed life.<br /><br />anyway , the first part of the tv film should have ended with him leaving england . there 's no doubt about that . the thing is : once abroad , a life of debauchery began ( with the infamous geneva period ) , but in italy byron also discovered a new life , both for his poetry ( inspired by italian comedy ) , already in venice , and for himself when he found the contessa teresa guiccioli and moved to ravenna ( afterwards , at the request of shelly , with teresa , to pisa ) . in other words , he was also * liberated * . his mind and life opened up ( and not only in the decadent sense ) , while england 's closed further as it fell into the gravitational pull of the victorian age . true , freedom was augusta - less , but this bitter - sweet freedom tastes sour in this film . we see a lonely , bored snob getting older.<br /><br />i mean , hell , byron never thought much about his poetry , except when he finally found his own voice in don juan ! apart from poetic and romantic developments , his relationship with shelly ( and the down - break ) should have been more documented . also , it is in italy in ravenna that he gets involved with politics and revolutionary ideas . this is important , as it shows that the decadent romantic and ultimately escapist language and person of childe harold is changing into the more planted - in - life realistic and lighter passion of the language and person of don juan . life and work are one . true , still a bit naive , but it 's what got him to greece ! and the whole thing came full circle in pisa , where shelley 's revolutionary spirit further ignited the spark . missolonghi was n't the bored snob suddenly looking for some action . it was the insights in italy ( the gambas ) stirring him into action . it can be a symbol for the man looking for some ancient - style battle excitement while the rest of europe becomes fixed in the clay of modern reason and conservatism . but it was n't just that , there was a true inspiration behind it . meanwhile , byron wrote massive amounts of don juan . true , his end is a bit sad , but it 's not like he 's worn out . that is the essence of byron 's life : he may have had some strong emotional attachments ( 2 : augusta and teresa ) , but every time he managed to reinvent himself truly . meaning that he was n't ' less ' at the end of his life - no , he 'd made a physical and mental journey that , at the time , few people were prepared to make.<br /><br />i wonder . why is it that so often the second period in byron 's life is overlooked ? because it had less obvious conflicts , as the man was finally coming to his own ? in focusing our attention on the frustrated england years fraught with scandals , we show ourselves to be not much better than the english aristocracy at the time , which byron so despised , and which , despite the fact that he had no choice , he * willingly * fled in 1816 , to find a world that was modern and liberal enough to let him find the voice that would make him the first romantic plainspoken language poet and evolve from a self - obsessed snob to a passionate man moving onward with a cause .", "label": 1}

{"text": "this is a complex film that explores the effects of fordist and taylorist modes of industrial capitalist production on human relations . there are constant references to assembly line production , where workers are treated as cogs in a machine , overseen by managers wielding clipboards , controlling how much hair the workers leave exposed , and firing workers ( stanley ) who meet all criteria ( as his supervisor says , are always on time , are hard workers , do good work ) but who may in some unspecified future make a mistake . < br /><br />this system destroys families - stanley has to send his father to a nursing home ( where he quickly dies ) after stanley loses his job . iris ' daughter is a single teen mother who drops out of high school to take a job in the plant . references are made to the fact that now , with declining wages , both partners need to work , the implication being that there 's nobody left at home to care for the kids . iris ' husband is dead from an illness , and with the multiple references in the film about the costs of medical care , the viewer must wonder if he might have lived with better and more costly care . iris ' brother in law gets abusive after yet another unsuccessful day at the unemployment office when his wife yells at him for buying a beer with her savings instead of leaving it for her face lift and/or teeth job ( even the working class with no stake in conventional bourgeois notions of perfection and beauty buy into them ) . the one reference to race in the film is through a black factory line worker whose husband is in jail ( presumably , he 's also black , and black men suffer disproportionally high incarceration rates ) . she remarks that he , like her , \" is doing time \" - her family is composed of a prisoner and a wage slave.<br /><br />stanley , however , still believes in human relations and is therefore for most of the film outside of the system of fordist capitalism . he cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his father 's traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy - he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract , as iris ' brother in law does ( suggesting that he \" married the wrong sister \" ) . he does not , as iris says , conform to the work - eat - sleep routine of everyone else ; rather , he uses technology and the techniques of industrial production in an artisanal and creative way , in a sort of bauhaus ideal . this was the dream of early modernists and 1920 's socialists ( such as the bauhaus ) - to use technology to provide for all basic needs , allowing for more free time for creative human work and fuller human relations . he is also outside of traditional gender relations . he cooks , he cleans , he cares for his family , and he knows how to iron . iris , on the other hand , lives in a traditionally male role - she 's a factory worker , the mains source of income for her ( extended ) family , and she brings stanley into the public realm , traditionally off - limits to women . by teaching him to read and write , she gives him access to the world of knowledge , also traditionally gendered male.<br /><br />literacy here is used as a metaphor for the ( traditionally masculine ) public realm and the systems of circulation ( monetary , vehicular , cultural ) that enable participation in the public realm . without this access , stanley is feminized - the jobs open to him are cooking and cleaning . he is excluded from all regular circulations , unable to participate in the monetary ( ca n't open a bank account ) , in the vehicular ( ca n't get a driver 's license , ca n't ride the bus ) , and in the social ( he asks if he exists if he ca n't write his name).<br /><br />after learning to read , he grabs books on auto repair , farming , and spirituality ( the bible ) . the word of god is therefore relativized , placed on the same value plane as how - to books . in fact , organized religion in general is only very occasionally present - the bible also appears on a dresser as the camera pans to find stanley and iris having sex . it is , however , acknowledged as a moral force - iris , clearly a character devoted to living a \" good \" life , mentions at the beginning of the film that her rosary was among the objects lost in a purse snatching.<br /><br />once able to read , he enters the system and lands a managerial position with a health care plan , a car , and a house , taking his place at the head of the family , the breadwinner . presumably , he 's an industrial designer , dreaming up products that will require others enduring the drudgery of the assembly line to produce . this ending , probably the only bit of conventional hollywood in the film , is so incongruous with all that has come before that i at least wonder if it was n't forced in by some studio exec suddenly worried about the lack of a feel - good ending and its potential effect on the bottom line.<br /><br />now that , according to the pundits , we 've comfortably moved on to post - industrial capitalism , the film also has a slightly nostalgic feel , as though we needed the historical distance to really analyze what happened during that period . < br /><br />nevertheless , it 's highly recommended - at least if you want to exercise your brain . disregard the ending , and it 's close to a perfect 10 .", "label": 1}

{"text": "el mar is a tough , stark , utterly brilliant , brave work of cinematic art . director agust\u00ed villaronga , with an adaptation by antoni aloy and biel mesquida of blai bonet 's novel , has created a film that traces the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure wrecks havoc on adult lives . and though the focus is on war 's heinous tattoo on children , the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear . this film becomes one of the finest anti - war documents without resorting to pamphleteering : the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following children 's march toward adulthood.<br /><br />a small group of children are shown in the spanish civil war of spain , threatened with blackouts and invasive nighttime slaughtering of citizens . ramala ( nilo mur ) , tur ( david lozano ) , julia ( sergi moreno ) , and francisca ( victoria verger ) witness the terror of the assassination of men , and the revenge that drives one of them to murder and suicide . these wide - eyed children become adults , carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their minds.<br /><br />we then encounter the three who survive into adulthood where they are all confined to a tuberculosis sanitarium . ramala ( roger casamajor ) has survived as a male prostitute , protected by his ' john ' morell ( juli mira ) , and has kept his life style private . tur ( bruno bergonzini ) has become a frail sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to catholicism and the blur of delusional self - mutilation / crucifixion . francisca ( ant\u00f2nia torrens ) has become a nun and serves the patients in the sanitarium . the three are re - joined by their environment in the sanitarium and slowly each reveals the scars of their childhood experiences with war . tur longs for ramala 's love , ramala longs to be free from his morell , and francisca must face her own internal needs covered by her white nun 's habit.<br /><br />the setting of the sanitarium provides a graphic plane where the thin thread between life and death , between lust and love , and between devotion and destruction is played out . to detail more would destroy the impact of the film on the individual viewer , but suffice it to say that graphic sex and full nudity are involved ( in some of the most stunningly raw footage yet captured on film ) and the viewer should be prepared to witness every form of brutality imaginable . for this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and director villaronga is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense . the actors , both as children and as adults , are splendid : roger cassamoor , bruno bergonzini and ant\u00f2nia torrens are especially fine in inordinately difficult roles . the cinematography by jaime peracaula and the haunting musical score by javier navarrete serve the director 's vision . a tough film , this , but one highly recommended to those who are unafraid to face the horrors of war and its aftermath . in spanish with english subtitles.<br /><br />grady harp", "label": 1}

{"text": "this gripping tale of intergenerational love , jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on dvd years after its pbs broadcast , with a sharper picture and crisper sound . my only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger manchester accents are difficult at times . luckily even missing a word here and there wo n't spoil the fun : the primary actors are ideally cast . robson green brings an enigmatic smile , a go - for - broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he 's just begun to work . francesca annis is one of the most striking 50-ish women imaginable ; her acting rivals her beauty . ( the love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them ! ) each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and excellently portrayed as well . the mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful miniseries . as russell baker notes in his introduction , you may not be morally improved by viewing \" reckless \" -- but you 'll have plenty of fun .

{"text": "zero day has a purpose and this is not simply entertainment , it delivers a message about its specialised subject school shootings . charting the lives of two friends andre and cal leading up to an attack on their high school . < br /><br />whilst the movie started in somewhat unassuming fashion , an impromptu announcement of the coming attack in amateurish teenage style followed by some brief encounters with the boys families . it is not long before we are down to business with the boys showing us their collection of guns , their fetishistic love of them , their sprawling sporadic narcissistic fantasies and even in a controversial scene how to build pipe bombs.<br /><br />so what is the movie trying to say ? what is really motivating these soon to be killers . it seems hard to really pinpoint . they certainly do not come across as cold blooded psychopaths yet they are planning an act of sheer brutality . this brings me to what i feel is the genius in part of zero day . cal and andre talk constantly about how much they are on a different level , how above the rest of us they are and how they will ' leave us all behind . ' like the columbine killers they truly feel superior . like nietzsche 's res sentiment cal and andre 's value system seems to have been born out of rejection from their society . yet we are given only glimpses of this , an expression of hatred for a popular athlete for example . so where is the motivation ? what i feel is that coccio portrayed two individuals desperate to make a statement of superiority a gesture of their power yet who have no reasonable venue for it . hence they turn to mass murder and the kind of which that will garner them more attention than they could ever realise . this is why in part school shooters seem able to carry out atrocious acts despite coming from good stable loving homes . the murder is part of a fantasy , cal and andre are totally lost in their fantasy they almost fail to see the reality of their actions . they turn fantasy into tragedy.<br /><br />what is secondly most enthralling about this film is the character development and the unique dependence cal and andre have on each other . andre is throughout the film overtly the leader of the two , cal 's embrace of his demeanour and attire seem somewhat forced . andre is uptight , andre is intense and serious . he completely shuns others except for his family , he is meticulous and precise about everything he does and for a while appears the prime mover in the plot to attack the school . yet he is likable in his own way , he does not embrace teenage nonsense and in part we feel compelled to agree with him , yet these moments are shattered by andre 's fleeting gestures of violence towards us the audience treating us as both confidante and potential victim . cal on the other hand seems more relaxed than andre , more accepting of reality . yet he is in his own way dominant . we have many personal moments of introspection with cal 's video diary , scenes when he is alone and apart from andre . cal seems to be struggling with his own personal demons and using their plan to exorcise himself of them . andre is jealous of cal going to the prom with an old friend , he wants cal all to himself . cal placates andre and encourages him . for the first time in his life andre seems to have found someone who believes in him and who admires him he can not lose it . whilst cal has found someone offering him a way out.<br /><br />the movie certainly picks up pace and improves as it nears its grim conclusion . there is an excellent moment when cal attends the high school prom . suddenly the star of the movie becomes shy and introverted , not at all at ease with his peers . yet we are inclined to feel more connection with cal than with the raucous bawdy crowd screaming juvenile obscenities whilst drinking heavily in their limo . theirs is an episode all too common and recognisable . we do not want to relate to them , when it is over and cal is back with andre silently preparing one of their final videos we like the characters feel once again at ease safe in the fantasy world they created . we feel like shunning the masses as they have.<br /><br />the penultimate scene is superb . the final video sees andre and cal arming themselves in their car just moments before attacking . it is all too real and truly creates a sense of impending doom . by know we know cal and andre and are realising they are about to actually do it , with a kind of morbid fascination we are also relishing the films catharsis.<br /><br />the massacre shot in cctv fashion is at times shocking , and whilst it was certainly the perfect choice to depict the massacre if we were going to it is not void of flaws . what is most significant is the sudden radical change of perception we have of cal and andre , looking at them in the this person suddenly they are the callous killers we knew they would become yet refused to acknowledge that they would . it is violent and real , our heroes have become monsters and the reality of their fantasy is a terrible tragedy , which costs them everything.<br /><br />the final scene shows a group of teens filming themselves burning the crosses erected for andre and cal in disgust that they have been memorialised . having known andre and cal we can only feel almost a sadness that they are actually gone forever and that they certainly did not win anything.<br /><br />zero day is a must see for anyone interested in these violent acts sensationalised by the media . it is a character study well worth experiencing .", "label": 1}

{"text": "* spoiler alert : i wish i could discuss this without revealing specific plot points , but i ca n't . sorry.*<br /><br />i was looking for an imdb review of the george c. scott movie when i stumbled across the summary and reviews for this version . it had so many positive reviews that i decided to order it even though : ( a)while truncated and rushed , i thought george c. scott embodied the tortured nature ( and physical appearance ) of the book 's rochester to a t ; and ( b)even while looking at the dvd 's cover , i was thinking \" is n't timothy dalton too good - looking for the role ? \" the latter concern was reinforced by the fact that i decided to re - read the book while the dvd was on backorder . that said , the minute i started watching this , i was captivated . at first it was disconcerting to hear 1840 's dialog spoken as written -- with little or no attempts at modernization -- but dalton and clarke threw themselves into it so thoroughly , that i actually enjoyed the fact that the adapters trusted the audience to follow archaic speech . to have so much of the book up on the screen was an extra bonus . i know someone who wo n't watch any versions of jane eyre because \" who wants to see a film about a man who keeps a poor crazy woman in the attic ? \" frankly , if someone who had n't read the book stumbled across the hour and a half or two hour versions , they would think that 's pretty much all the story entails -- rochester 's secret and its affect on everyone around him . luckily , this version is actually about jane eyre 's whole life.<br /><br />some people have criticized the casting . dalton is too dashing ; clarke is too reserved . i ca n't argue against the first point , but he is so \" in the moment \" that i believe he is rochester . to me , clarke 's performance is on the mark . jane eyre is quiet , guarded . if one remembers the book , so much of the adult jane 's fieriness and passion occurs during her private struggles . some of the criticisms baffle me . reviewers say clarke is too short or is n't pretty enough . the book goes on ad infinitum about how small and plain jane is . ms. clarke should n't be tall and the filmmakers toned down her looks to make jane 's declarations of her lack of beauty credible . she can scarcely help it if dalton is tall . some say there is no chemistry between the leads . what ? ! ! the scene when jane finally comes out of her room after the wedding fiasco fairly vibrates with passion and longing and sadness and regret -- and that 's just the first example that comes to mind.<br /><br />i do agree with some of the other criticisms . i too missed more scenes with helen burns and the rivers siblings . some of the dialog was oddly truncated . when rochester declares , \" jane , you misjudge me . i do not hate her because she is mad , \" i waited for the rest of the exchange when rochester explains how if jane were to go mad , he would still love and care for her . it 's a powerful moment in the book , and i wish it had been included . i think it was a mistake to bring a scene with rochester into the part of the story where jane is on her own . it might have been done for clarity 's sake , but i found it jarring . i wanted the sly humor of the scene where jane opines that rochester 's ardor will cool and he 'll become gruff again , but he may \" like \" her again by and by . dalton 's performance is so good that the rare misstep is glaring -- when rochester weeps in the library , i saw him as an actor doing a crying scene , not as rochester . as for the sets , if anyone has ever caught an episode of the 1960 's show \" dark shadows , \" one knows what to expect -- very stark and sometimes rickety looking interiors . others have commented thoroughly and succinctly about the make - up job rochester sports at the end . yikes ! it is bad . the conclusion is too abrupt . after all that anguish and suspense , i wanted a more rounded off ending . and , on my copy of the dvd , having credits at the beginning and end of all eleven 25 - 30 minute episodes gets to be a bit much . that said , i am so glad i have this film and will watch it again and again .", "label": 1}

{"text": "paul armstrong is a liberal , scottish - born , professor of law at harvard , known for his passionate opposition to the death penalty , who is hired to take on the case of bobby earl , a young black man from florida who has been convicted of the rape and murder of joanie shriver , an eleven year old white girl . earl claims that his confession to the crime was obtained under duress by a sadistic police officer and that the real murderer is blair sullivan , a serial killer already under sentence of death for several other murders . armstrong visits sullivan in his cell on death row , hoping to persuade him to confess to joanie 's murder , thereby saving earl from the electric chair . < br /><br />at first all goes well . sullivan confesses and earl is released from prison when the appeal court quashes his conviction . as this development takes place only a little after halfway through the film , it is at this point that alarm bells will start ringing in the mind of the viewer . \" warning ! major plot twist ahead ! \" and so it proves . the anticipated twist soon materialises . earl , it transpires , is actually guilty of the crime of which he has just been acquitted , and probably of several others as well , but hatched a diabolical plan together with sullivan in order to secure his freedom ; sullivan will confess to joanie 's murder if earl will murder his parents . ( just why sullivan wanted his parents dead is never precisely explained ) . armstrong now finds that he is himself in danger from the man whose life he has just saved ; earl has a grudge against armstrong 's wife , herself a lawyer , who acted as counsel for the prosecution in an earlier case when earl was accused of rape . < br /><br />\"just cause \" is an example of the auto - cannibalism in which hollywood sometimes likes to indulge , cobbling together one film by recycling themes and plot devices from a number of others . the first half owes an obvious debt to films like \" intruder in the dust \" and \" to kill a mockingbird \" ; about the only difference is that the sheriff who beats a confession out of bobby earl is himself black , whereas in earlier films he would have been white . ( police brutality is now an equal opportunities activity ) . the central twist in the plot was borrowed from costa - gavras 's \" music box \" , although in that film the revelation does not occur until the very end . the finale , in which a lawyer , his wife and their young daughter are in danger from a former client , is an obvious plagiarism of the two versions of \" cape fear \" , which also take place in the swamplands of the american south . ed harris ' characterisation of sullivan as a bible - quoting religious maniac is a direct imitation of robert de niro 's character in the scorsese version of \" cape fear \" , made four years before \" just cause \" . < br /><br />(there is a postscript . just as \" just cause \" borrowed heavily from several other movies , seven years later its central plot twist was , in its turn , to be blatantly plagiarised in the ashley judd vehicle \" high crimes \" ) . < br /><br />the trouble with this style of film - making - by - numbers is that the resulting films are generally much less distinguished than those which inspired them . the whole is normally very much less than the sum of the parts , and \" just cause \" is a much lesser film than any of those which were cannibalised to make it . harris is normally a gifted actor but this is one of his weakest performances , largely because he is not so much playing a character as playing de niro playing max cady . blair underwood is ok as bobby earl the ( supposedly ) innocent young man of the early scenes , but unconvincing as bobby earl the murderous psychopath of the later ones . sean connery as armstrong and laurence fishburne as the black sheriff are rather better , but neither is good enough to save the film . ( connery and harris were to act together in another , better , film , \" the rock \" , the following year ) . < br /><br />there is another problem with \" just cause \" . the first half of the film looks like a standard liberal \" issue \" movie , anti - death penalty , anti - racist and critical of heavy - handed policing . the second half looks more like the work of a die - hard reactionary , preaching the message that all criminals are evil bastards , that the only way to deal with them is to fry them in the chair , that liberal lawyers are the useful idiots of the criminal fraternity and that police officers who beat up suspects are to be commended as heroes . the filmmakers seem to have been blissfully unaware that the plot twist casually introduced into the middle of their film had the ( presumably unwanted ) effect of reversing its political stance , or if they were aware of the problem they ignored it . a suitably convoluted plot was obviously thought to be more important than political consistency . 4/10", "label": 1}

{"text": "in christian duguay 's movie , hitler : the rise of evil , hitler 's early years in life and politics is shown in a successful way with some minor historical errors and some exaggeration . it is quite natural for a hollywood movie to contain such things as the main purpose of production is the income that they will get from the movie . even though such errors may disappoint some members of the audience who believes that everything should be done by the book , i believe that most of them fits well with the rest of the movie , making it more interesting . we should not forget that this movie is not a documentary . who cares how did his dog died anyway.<br /><br />throughout the movie , hitler is portrayed as a psychologically unstable figure that gets angry very easily and is very passionate about his ideals . but he was not portrayed as a super - villain but more like an ambitious politician . i believe that this is a nice perspective as the movie is not contaminated by tons of negative emotions and this made the movie somewhat objective . yes he was a little mad , and his methods were rough but he was still a human not a totally insane figure as portrayed in \" inglorious bastards \" . i believe it made the movie more realistic even with some inaccuracies in the historical facts.<br /><br />the flow of history is nicely reflected to spectators . even though the movie 's focus was around hitler we also had chance to see what is happening in the country as a result of these actions via newspapers , discussions of people and the songs in a jewish cabaret . also society 's reaction was also reflected to movie but it was very limited . struggles of journalist fritz gerlich and ironic plays that are played in the cabaret was amusing and interesting but that was all . mostly we only saw his followers rampaging the streets and cheering him.<br /><br />another thing that was missing in the movie is information about the origins of his hatred for jews . in the beginning of the movie , some ideas about this is given but they were quite superficial . all of a sudden he was a politician who is giving speeches about necessity of extermination of jews.<br /><br />in conclusion , hitler : the rise of evil can not be considered as an excellent movie that everyone will like but it is not unsatisfactory at all . if you can stand directors that change history for cash , it is an interesting movie reflecting hitler 's personality in a successful way .", "label": 1}

since when did zombies hide themselves yet alone under piles of grass ? this all may sound ' fun ' but believe me it 's not , it 's a really bad film that is just boring , repetitive & simply does n't work on any level as a piece of entertainment except for a few unintentional laughs.<br /><br />it 's hard to know who was responsible for what exactly but none of the footage is particularly well shot . it has a bland lifeless feel about it & for some reason the makers have tried to bath every scene in mist , the problem is they clearly only had one fog machine & you can see that at one corner of the screen the mist is noticeably thicker as it is coming straight out of the machine & thinning out as it disperses across the scene . since a lot of it is set during the day it does n't add any sort of atmosphere whatsoever & when they do get it right & the mist is evenly spread across the screen it just looks like they shot the scene on a foggy day ! the direction is poor with no consistency & it just looks & feels bottom of the barrel stuff . even the blood & gore is n't up to much , there 's a gory hand severing at the start , a scene when something rips out of a pregnant woman 's stomach , a legless woman ( what actually took her legs off in the pool by the way & why did n't it take the legs off the guy who jumped in to save her ? ) & a few ok looking zombies is as gory as it gets . for anyone hoping to see a gore fest the likes of which fulci regularly served up during the late 70 's & early 80 's will be very disappointed , there are n't any decent feeding scenes , no intestines , no stand out ' head shots ' & very little gore at all.<br /><br />technically the film is poor , the special effects are cheap looking , the cinematography is dull , the music is terrible , the locations are bland & it has rock bottom production values . this was actually shot in the philippines to keep the cost down to a minimum . the entire film is obviously dubbed , the acting still looks awful though & the english version seems to have been written by someone who does n't understand the language that well.<br /><br />zombi 3 is not a sequel to fulci 's classic zombie gore fest zombi 2 ( 1979 ) , it has nothing to do with it at all apart from the cash - in title . i 'm sorry but zombi 3 is an amateurish mess of a film , it 's boring , it makes no sense , it 's not funny enough to be entertaining & it lacks any decent gore . one to avoid .", "label": 1}

that 's the only reason i can think of why this horrible romantic comedy ( and i use that term loosely because there 's nothing funny in this film ) is getting good reviews.<br /><br />i sat through this film stunned that screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel would even for an instant think their script was funny.<br /><br />the brilliant nick hornby usually translates well to film . he adapted \" fever pitch \" for a british film starring colin firth and ruth gemmell in 1997 ; peter hedges found hornby 's voice for \" about a boy \" ( 2002 ) and when \" high fidelity \" was americanized for a movie in 2000 , writers d.v. devincentis , steve pink , john cusack and scott rosenberg did n't go wrong because they kept the essence of hornby 's wit and humor . they made one of the best films of that year.<br /><br />so why does the american version of \" fever pitch \" go so painfully awry ? the british version was n't a masterpiece , but it was charming , funny , unexpected and gave us two characters we could like , respect and understand.<br /><br />but ganz and mandel have excised everything funny in hornby 's work . in americanizing the story , they 've butchered it , removing all that was good and unique about hornby 's work and replacing it with conventional drivel.<br /><br />they've transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy , never once veering from the wretched formula . lindsey ( drew barrymore ) has three girlfriends , each of whom has a distinct function . one 's overweight , the second 's cynical and ambitious , and the third 's a romantic . want to guess how many male friends ben ( jimmy fallon ) has?<br /><br />what made \" high fidelity \" such fun was not only a good leading man and lady , but engaging supporting characters . in this \" fever pitch , \" the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny . they 're so insignificant , they 're not even decorative . the only reason they 're in the film is because the formula demands it . poor ione skye winds up as one lindsey 's pals in a thankless role . the lovely skye must have been wishing lloyd dobler would swoop in and take her away . come to think of it , cusack would 've made an excellent ben . of course , cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious script.<br /><br />there is n't a single , solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced . every plot turn is predictable , every lame joke telegraphed . ganz and mandel labor for laughs . the first 45 minutes are so excruciatingly slow , you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy . you can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch . it 's almost as if ganz and mandel penned this with some screen writing guru 's formula pasted on the wall . when they got to a certain page , they looked up at the formula and said , \" ok , the guru says this has to happen now . \" and , presto!<br /><br />directors bobby and peter farrelly do n't help the film any . they have no concept how to introduce their story and characters ( they hand over the v.o. narration not to the protagonist , but to another guy who sits behind ben at fenway park ) . thanks to some extremely clunky writing , we have to watch barrymore and fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetings.<br /><br />barrymore does cute and adorable better than most . she 's as good at it as goldie hawn in her heyday . but even her cuteness ca n't save this extraordinarily awful film . she tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story . about 30 minutes into the film , lindsey tells ben , \" you 're funny . \" the only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script . for fallon 's ben never says anything even remotely funny . fallon is neither witty nor funny ; when he does comedy , he overacts.<br /><br />fallon was never any good on \" saturday night live . \" he was quite possibly the least funny person on that show . remember that lame sketch about a radio dj who did all the voices ? the only reason \" weekend update \" worked occasionally was because fallon 's cohort , tina fey , knows a thing or two about comedy.<br /><br />actors who think they 're funny and behave that way rarely , if ever , are actually funny . that 's true of fallon . he thinks he 's hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle . his stuttering , unsure - of - himself shtick did n't work on the small screen ; it 's lousier on the big screen.<br /><br />unfortunately for fallon , his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments . if you thought his comedy was bad , wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff . two scenes in particular - the first in a park , the second in front of ben 's school - are painful to watch . the scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability , but fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work . his range of emotions does n't even run the gamut from a to b.<br /><br />ben has no personality or depth . often , he comes across as an oaf . and not a lovable one at that . it boggles the mind what lindsey would find attractive about him . compare fallon 's performance to firth 's in the british version , and you 'll understand how terribly flat , unfunny and forced fallon 's ben is and how wrong he is for this role . watching fallon in \" fever pitch \" makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of ashton kutcher!<br /><br />just as \" high fidelity \" did , an americanized \" fever pitch \" could 've worked brilliantly . it just needed better writers , more competent directors and , most definitely , a stronger , funnier , smarter leading man . do yourself a huge favor : avoid this rotten film ; rent the 1997 british version and read hornby 's book , instead .", "label": 1}
{"text": "new york , i love you , or rather should - be - titled manhattan , i love looking at your people in sometimes love , is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation . case in point , look at two of the segments in the film , one where ethan hawke lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexy - talk , and another with orlando bloom trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two dostoyevsky books . while the latter is n't a great story by any stretch , it 's at least something that has a beginning , middle and end , as the composer tries to score , gets dostoyevky dumped in his lap , and in the end gets some help ( and maybe something more ) from a girl he 's been talking to as a liaison between him and the director . the ethan hawke scene , however , is like nothing , and feels like it , like a fluke added in or directed by a filmmaker phoning it in ( or , for that matter , hawke with a combo of before sunrise and reality bites).<br /><br />what 's irksome about the film overall is seeing the few stories that do work really well go up against the one or two possible ' stories ' and then the rest of the situations that unfold that are made to connect or overlap with one another ( i.e. bits involving bradley cooper , drea dematteo , hayden christensen , andy garcia , james caan , natalie portman , etc ) . it 's not even so much that the film- set practically always in * manhattan * and not the new york of queens or staten island or the bronx ( not even , say , harlem or washington heights)- lacks a good deal of diversity , since there is some . it 's the lack of imagination that one found in spades , for better or worse , in paris j'taime . it 's mostly got little to do with new york , except for passing references , and at its worst ( the julie christie / shia labeouf segment ) it 's incomprehensible on a level that is appalling.<br /><br />so , basically , wait for tv , and do your best to dip in and out of the film - in , that is , for three scenes : the aforementioned bloom / christina ricci segment which is charming ; the brett ratner directed segment ( yes , x - men 3 brett ratner ) with a very funny story of a teen taking a girl in a wheelchair to the prom only to come upon a great big twist ; and eli wallach and cloris leachman as an adorable quite old couple walking along in brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary . everything else can be missed , even natalie portman 's directorial debut , and the return of a hughes brother ( only one , allan ) to the screen . a mixed bag is putting it lightly : it 's like having to search through a bag of mixed nuts full of crappy peanuts to find the few almonds left .", "label": 1}

; do i love her ? what is love ? what do i do ? \" and it gets so repetitive , it 's not even able to act as good humour . this twinned with the way he always seemed to be on the phone to someone : a girl called maerose prizzi ( huston ) played by director john 's daughter ; which served absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever and seemed to be there for laughs as was the scene in which she tells her father about how she slept with partanna and loved it \u0096 that got me thinking , was this supposed to be funny ? should i be laughing ? the film felt like a smart mafia picture what with its opening scene of a wedding ( al\u00e1 the godfather ) and consequential scenes with a touch of noir as gangsters , police men and assassins were introduced into the film . but what we get is something very , very different.<br /><br />the second hour revolves around some sort of a kidnap plot ; right , the love and romance is dealt with \u0096 maybe the film will kick - start . i was so very wrong : with more characters continuously talking very slowly and very deliberately in a monotone way , we have a kidnap scene involving some guy coming out of his office : this scene sums the film up . everything is briefly planned and then executed in a heavy handed and dumb way that just makes it look cheesy . we do not get to see them arrive to some dramatic music ; perhaps they have to get through security to get to the elevators ; maybe they have to be careful of civilians when they hide in their chosen places and when that random woman steps out of the elevator and the gunshot occurs \u0096 the scene is n't even edited correctly . some suspense , some drama : \" do i shoot or do n't i ? \" ; maybe some slow motion as the character has to quick draw before it 's too late \u0096 anything but how it was actually executed . prizzi 's honor continues its monotonous and uninteresting decent into filmic oblivion as it nears its climax . it 's a film where cameras reflect in windows ; lights reflect in sides of cars and ' dead ' chauffeurs blink when nudged . prizzi 's honor is a jumbled and messy film that will try the patients of any film - goer and do n't say it was a comedy because i did n't laugh with it \u0096 at it is another matter . the film is repetitive , drawn out and colourless in its vision and scope for originality - there is no honour here .", "label": 1}

{"text": "mr. destiny - 3.5/5 stars < br /><br />\"mr . destiny 's \" theme is recycled from many films spanning many different years . its theme ranges from recent spoofs on such plots ( see \" scrooged \" ) , to the same , more serious and dramatic notion that worked in \" it 's a wonderful life , \" and a century earlier in the story of scrooge as told by charles dickens in \" a christmas carol . \" \" it involves an ungrateful man being taken on a guided tour of his life , and witnessing how his life could have been ( or would have been ) first - hand . < br /><br />in most of these types of movies the guardian angel rescues a man from ungratefulness and shows him his life in retrospect , or how it could have been . should have been . would have been . in this case we are shown a businessman named larry ( james belushi ) . he hates his life . he lives with an unexciting wife ( linda hamilton ) and yearns for a bigger life with bigger meaning . if only he had hit the ball at the state championship in high school years ago . he is convinced his life would have been better . i guess he remembers this seemingly small moment of his life because it made a big impact on his subconscious side , but i doubt a grown man would yearn for one single act from high school . still , it works in the movie.<br /><br />anyway , larry is driving home from work one night , where he is a penpusher along with jon lovitz , when his car breaks down . he wanders into a bar looking for a pay phone , and reluctantly decides to tell the bartender ( michael caine ) about the way his life is turning out . this is where we first see him remembering his childhood baseball strike - out.<br /><br />the bartender listens and nods , apparently not worrying about any other customers . this is probably due to the fact that the bar , though old and tattered , seems to have never been occupied by any living humans save these two men . in fact , larry even makes a comment about never seeing the bar before . this is most likely for a certain reason that the audience is expecting before larry . < br /><br />so the bartender , who may as well be an angel of god incarnate , just like clarence , fixes larry a special drink of his , which ends up putting larry 's life on reverse , showing him what his life would have been like if he had hit the home run all those years before . but larry has no idea of any change at first , just like jimmy stewart did n't realize that clarence had erased his life until he went into the bar and got kicked out larry continues to be oblivious to any change until he goes to his home to find the lawn different outside , and a large , wrestler - type man occupying his home.<br /><br />larry soon finds out his life would indeed have been very different had he hit the home run . instead of marrying linda hamilton he married rene russo and moved into a large mansion with children . he finds out that jon lovitz is no longer his friend but an employee of his . and the most surprising fact of all is that with his new life , that larry has always wanted ... he finds himself lusting after his old wife , linda hamilton ; proof that sometimes money and a great - looking yet shallow wife do n't make up everything in a man 's life , like an intelligent wife and love and true happiness . just like \" it 's a wonderful life \" showed the audience a man 's life is what he makes it , and that every person has an impact on people , \" mr. destiny \" shows us that material wealth is not the same as spiritual wealth , a lesson taught us over and over again , but never quite so fluffy , forgettable and truly sweet as it is shown us in \" mr. destiny . \"<br /><br />\"mr . destiny \" is never exceedingly hilarious , but it is a sweet , good - natured comedy that never takes itself too seriously . the problem with all the \" it 's a wonderful life \" retreads out there , like \" the family man , \" is that they try to be as influential and memorable as \" it 's a wonderful life \" was . but there are only so many times you can single - handedly rip off a famous film , and \" mr. destiny \" knows this , and plays right to the fact . it does n't try to be anything it is n't ; rather , it is something it did n't try to be , and this is obvious to the audience . < br /><br / >", "label": 1}
{"text": "this , the finest achievement from georg wilhelm pabst 's social realism period is based upon a tragedy in early 1906 that claimed the lives of nearly 1100 french miners as a coal dust explosion deep in mines at courrieres in northern france took place after a fire had smouldered for three weeks , eventually releasing deadly pit gas that brought about the fatalities . estimable designer erno metzner creates stark sets that simulate the tragedy , providing a perception of reality , augmented by matchless sound editing , with the only music being produced by integral orchestras during the beginning and ending portions of a work for which aural effects possess equal importance with the eminent director 's fascinating visual compositions . pabst 's manner of \" invisible editing \" that segues action from shot to shot through movements of players proves to be smoothly integrated within this landmark film that also showcases sublime cinematography utilizing cameras mounted upon vehicles , enabling the director to shift amid scenes without having a necessity of cutting . although the work 's cardinal theme relates to socialist dogma , the unforgettable power of this film is held in its details , born of pabst 's nonpareil skill at weaving numerous plot lines into a cinema tapestry that stirs one to admiration for german rescue squads of whom their fatherland is greatly proud while no less despairing of disastrous losses to the families of french victims ; certainly , a seminal triumph fully as stimulating today to a cineaste as it was at the time of its first release .", "label": 1}

{"text": "this film , in my opinion , is , despite it 's flaws ( which i maintain are * few * ) , an utter masterpiece and a great and glorious piece of art.<br /><br />what mr. bakshi has done here is to create an utterly beautiful film and has shown his immense talent and versatility as a director of animated films . he does not receive 1/100th of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience . if it were not for mr. bakshi , i do n't believe animation would have survived the disney onslaught . what is more , with the lord of the rings , he has not only created a beautiful animated film , but he has created an entirely new art form - unfortunately one that never quite made it off the ground.<br /><br />most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the film ( the use of live action images which are used as background images and often animated over using various techniques from what appears to be small amounts of tinting to full blown animation ) . but i feel that the people who complain about it simply can not accept an art form which is out of the norm . no , this is not disney animation . no it 's not live action . no , it 's not \" cheating \" - what it is is a new , fascinating , and absolutely wonderful art form . something so fresh , and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic tale as \" the lord of the rings \" . bakshi 's pioneering use of this technique brings the subtleties of middle earth to life is a very dark and mysterious way , in particular , the darker of tolkien 's creatures , particularly the nazgul , are realized in a way that traditional animation or live action have not been able to accomplish.<br /><br />peter s. beagle 's screenplay ( based very little , as i understand it , on an early draft by chris conkling ) is a very loyal adaptation of tolkien 's works . where possible he uses dialogue directly out of the novel and it feels at home in the world which bakshi has created . there are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 3/4 into a single 2 hour 15 minute film , but there are very few changes to the storyline . there are a few holes which it would have been nice to have filled : the reforging of narsil , the gifts of galadriel , the huorns at the battle of the hornburg , but , again , with the time limitations he had ( already the longest animated feature in history ) , these are certainly understandable ( though it makes one wonder how they could have been explained in a sequel).<br /><br />also there is the delightful ( one of my favorites ) score by leonard rosenman ( who also scored barry lyndon and star trek iv ( the score for which is clearly based on his lotr work ) ) . it is bombastic and audacious and , dare i say , perfect . it stands on it 's own as an orchestral triumph , but when coupled with the images of the film , it enters a whole new world of symphonic perfection . so far from the typical hollywoodland fare that it turns many people off.<br /><br />the voice actors are wonderful . of particular note is john hurt as aragorn who just oozes the essence of strider.<br /><br />the character design is also wonderfully unique , though not often to everyone 's taste . but remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show you what he / she imagines , not what you might have imagined , and so aragorn is realized with a distinctive native american feel and boromir appears in viking inspired garb . this is perhaps not what you imagined , but i can only applaud mr. bakshi for showing us what he \" saw \" . it also might be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with priscilla tolkien in developing the character outfits for the film.<br /><br />one farther word - the flight to the ford sequence , in my opinion , is one of the most subtlety beautiful sequences ever to be caught on celluloid . bakshi is not afraid to slow down the pace for a moment , and his mastery is clearly shown by the incredible tension is able to build . bakshi 's artistic ability and tolkien 's incredible work fuse in this sequence to a glorious peak which has yet to be equaled.<br /><br />the recent dvd release ( 2001 ) by warner brothers , is sorely lacking . while we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen format , the package is woefully short of extras . how glorious it would have been to have had a director 's commentary , been able to see the 20 minutes of extra footage that were removed for the theatrical release . another delightful addition could have been the assembled the live action footage which was later animated over . also present in the dvd release is the utterly horrible voiceover at the end of the film which is a departure from the simple voiceover which occurred in the very final frames of the film . this version is plastered and poorly rendered right over the musical climax of the score.<br /><br />of course , the greatest tragedy of all is that the sequel was never made . we will never be able to see bakshi 's interpretation of gondor , of shelob , of faramir , of the cracks of doom , of eowyn 's battle with the witch king or gandalf 's confrontation with him . we will never be graced with bakshi 's image of denethor or the palatir or the paths of the dead . it is a shame beyond all shames that we will , in the end , have to accept peter jackson 's glitz and glitter hollywood , action film version of these later events in tolkien 's masterpiece , but , i suppose even that is better than having no cinematic version at all.<br /><br />david", "label": 1}

{"text": "just watched this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself . seriously , even if you read all the negative comments on here you will be nowhere near able to comprehend how awful this film actually is , although it has to be one of the most hilarious things i have ever seen ! never bothered to post a comment on here before , but this piece of crap really warrants it . < br /><br />firstly the entire plot is ridiculous and nonsensical . brother of the lead character ( either ben or arthur , i forget which is which , and frankly it 's never very clear ) wants to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight - because homosexuality is abhorrent to christians , but apparently mass murder is n't . then there 's some other crap thrown in about one of the gay couple 's ex - wife trying to force him to remarry her at gunpoint . this leads to nothing , but provides us with one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole \" film \" - \" i do n't make sense ? you do n't make sense ! that 's who makes sense ! \" . brilliant.<br /><br />then there 's the acting , which is just atrocious . it must be seen to be believed . my personal favourite is the apparently stoned civil rights lawyer woman , who is clearly reading her lines off of something , yet still managing to mess them up . enough said . the gay couple could n't be less convincing . there 's the vaguely attractive and completely gormless guy , and his boyfriend who looks like that little cartoon dough man of the bisto adverts . only fatter . and less talented . < br /><br />the \" film \" has also been filmed by someone who is incapable of holding a camera even remotely still , and the number of mistakes throughout is amazing . the whole thing kicks off with the fat main guy in bed with a pair of boots on . yep.<br /><br />but anyways , we all know how terrible this thing is , so i 'd like to highlight some of the most priceless comedy moments that the \" film \" provides . < br /><br />- when the fat guy sets the church on fire and then prances like a six year old girl across the car park to make his escape . hilarious.<br /><br />- mildread ! no idea what relation she is to the main characters - sometimes they know her , sometimes they do n't , but she pops up in a couple of scenes nonetheless . hilarious.<br /><br />- the stoned lawyer . already mentioned her , but she 's so funny she 's worth another mention.<br /><br />- the evil brothers dinner of crackers that he lays on for his guests.<br /><br />- the evil brother 's anti - gay potion.<br /><br />- the evil brother 's cats.<br /><br />- the ending , which i wo n't give away because it must be seen to be believed . i warn you though , make sure you 're not eating at the time ! ! ! ! the tub of lard main character / director / producer gets naked . it 's foul . < br /><br />basically , ben and arthur is indescribably bad , but unintentionally the most comical thing you 'll see for a long time . literally , nothing is good about this excuse for a film , the goon of a director even manages to make the opening credits into a joke by writing his own name about 15 times .", "label": 1}

{"text": "i 've seen most of ryuhei kitamura 's work and i 've come to the conclusion that he has a knack for action . scenes are kinetic and fast often combining elements of martial arts , gun fights and samurai fights with camera work that effectively captures the on screen carnage . with \" versus \" and \" aragami \" kitamura demonstrated that creativity and showed that he his more than capable of working with a low budget . so what happened in \" alive \" ? to be more blunt , the answer would be - nothing . nothing happened in \" alive \" it was a two hours plus movie with little to no action and little to no characters and plot.<br /><br />adapted from a comic book by tsutomu takahashi \" alive \" is an examination of the life of one tenshu yashiro ( played by hideo sasaki ) a death row convict who survives his execution . he is then given a choice of either to repeat the execution or to subject himself in a bizarre series of experiments . he chooses the latter and soon after that is placed in a room along with a rapist and later with a girl infected with a strange parasite that in exchange for it 's host 's humanity grants supernatural powers . naturaly at some point that parasite moves into yashiro , the bad thing is that does n't happen very soon . < br /><br />similar to \" aragami \" , \" alive \" sets it 's first half in establishing the basic exposition . characters are introduced , their motivations are set and their relations between each other are uncovered . the whole thing even takes place in just one set . the first major problem of that comparison is that while \" aragami \" was just a 70 minute movie , \" alive \" drags on for more than two hours thus making the first part over one hour long . that length could have been justified had the characters been made a bit more interesting but alas that is not the case . dialogue is dry , monotonous , delivered without any sense of emotion or depth , characters themselves are n't much interesting . there were some small attempts at making \" alive \" a bit more moral ambiguous but in the end it all came down to the classic : evil government people against , super - powered protagonist , whom yes you guessed it , saves the girl in the end . like i previously said the entire film practically takes place at just one set , and after two hours that does get boring , even worse the set design itself was n't even interesting to begin with , and does n't do much to improve on other aspects of the film.<br /><br />now , after that first part is over , one might think that kitamura would at least make some entertaining action scenes to make up for the boring beginning . sadly that is not the case . the two only fights are actually rehashes of similar fights from hollywood movies , complete with bullet time effects and psychic powers . they 're just not interesting or fun , kitamura 's creativity from \" versus \" is gone , the small set even limits his often very impressive camera - work and it all boils down into generic and expectable fights , a shame really.<br /><br />evidently \" aragami \" was better on all accounts and \" kitamura \" had learned something from \" alive \" . so it was n't at least a total loss watching this movie . if only to understand the errors made , how to fix them and create a better more entertaining movie .", "label": 1}

{"text": "what we 've got here is a situation . a man is found to be in distress and people want to help him -- in contrasting ways . at the end they are forced to let it go . you ca n't fix people . and though in various aspects reign over me is conventionally hollywood , that message isn't.<br /><br />this story is not about charlie fineman ( adam sandler ) , a man who lost his wife and three daughters in a 9/11 plane who 's gone into a nearly psychotic state of ptss since . it 's about what meeting charlie does to alan johnson ( don cheadle ) , a dentist in new york who was his roommate in dental school and , knowing about his tragedy , spots him on the street and reconnects . charlie is riding around on a little toy motorized scooter -- a pretty fanciful contraption for negotiating manhattan traffic -- with big headphones on over a mass of unruly hair . the hair is sandler 's chief prop to show he 's deranged . and the use of music as an escape must hit home to every ipod - wielding subway rider.<br /><br />charlie is a disaster , but paradoxically alan , stuck with a controlling wife ( jada pinkett smith ) , soon begins to envy him . charlie is living like an nutty adolescent boy with a huge trust fund ( insurance money from the tragedy ) , and starts dragging alan off to \" hang out , \" \" eat chinese , \" buy records , or watch a mel brooks marathon at a rep house . charlie lives in a nice big apartment protected by a mean landlady , redoing the kitchen over and over , collecting old vinyl of springsteen , the who , etc . , and playing a video game called shadow of the collosus on a giant screen in a big empty living room.<br /><br />charlie 's in - laws are deeply concerned about him , but also somehow resentful , as we learn later . alan has a new patient who is propositioning him . charlie 's desperation makes us see alan 's . trying to help charlie partly permits alan to escape from his own stifling realities but partly just makes him more acutely aware of them.<br /><br />cheadle and sandler make an odd couple , but that does n't matter , because it 's convincing that they might both need each other . charlie is desperate for the companionship of a friend who never knew his family , because to escape his loss , he is pretending he never had one . and so what if as a roommate charlie slept naked and sleep walked and had terrible musical taste ( no motown ) ? alan wants an escape from his tidy , emasculating life . he 's under the thumb not just of his wife but of his dental partners , who lord it over him though it 's he who set up the practice . they 're white , by the way , and he 's black.<br /><br />there 's also the lascivious patient from hell , who seriously disrupts things at the dental offices , but starts looking different when charlie comes by and notices she 's a babe . his libido seems to be lurking ready to revive at any minute . he 's also drawn to the breasts of liv tyler , a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists who starts trying to treat charlie when he admits he might need help.<br /><br />sandler 's mad scenes are a little too theatrical , as are a lot of the plot devices ( in fact this movie feels like a play at more than one point ) , but he has several monologues where he expresses his sorrow in ways that are deeply touching.<br /><br />charlie 's not just delusional and sad , but dangerous and violent , and all these efforts to help him start to backfire . the movie is admirable in the way it conveys a sense that people ca n't be made right . this is an interesting movie -- sometimes a touching one -- and it 's the first time 9/11 has been dealt with in terms of survivor suffering . but there is an element of comedy that seems tasteless at times , many of the people are too broadly drawn , and the overly grand hollywood interiors have dreadful d\u00e9cor ; only the manhattan streets look real . there 's a courtroom scene that is preposterous , and donald sutherland is a judge who 's too good to be true . alan 's family problem is resolved too easily with a phone call . and yet this is worth watching for the acting -- the control and subtlety of cheadle , and sandler in a serious role almost as good as the one he had in p.t. anderson 's 2002 punch - drunk love , though that 's clearly a better movie , in fact a much better one .", "label": 1}

{"text": "if you want to see a movie that terribly mixes up one latin country with any other latin country , \" the celestine prophecy \" is a good example : 1 . per\u00fa , not even in its most violent times , has not shown polices or soldiers as much as in this film . this showed a country like el salvador when civil war . since i 'm a peruvian who lives in lima ( the capital of per\u00fa ) , it was too funny to me seeing the police guards here , there and everywhere . 2 . if you have a car in per\u00fa , and you want ( or need ) to be a taxi driver , just post a sticker with the word \" taxi \" on the front glass of your car and you can drive freely in peruvian streets ( there are taxi companies , but their rates are quite expensive ) . no need of yellow or a black / white squared band on the doors of your car . well , taxis in this film have that band , somethin that you will never see in per\u00fa . 3 . peruvian people are not caribbean styled clothing . for example , when a taxi driver comes out , he was wearing a \" guayabera \" ( cuban shirt ) , a white hat , and 40 's mustaches , like clark gable . not one peruvian man looks like that , please ! per\u00fa is not the caribbeans ! 4 . a scene shows a woman on a street with a quite long skirt , like the typical folklore dresses in latin america . take a walk anywhere in per\u00fa , and you 'll never find a woman wearing like that , unless you are watching a typical dance . 5 . cast could 've been better : i can not deny h\u00e9ctor elizondo is a great actor , but he 's not a latin actor ( his father was basque and his mother from puerto rico , but he was born in new york ) and his spanish is not fluent . it 's notorious spanish is not his first language . there are dozens of very good latin actors who could 've performed as cardinal sebasti\u00e1n . petrus antonius ( general rodr\u00edguez ) was also a bad choice for a \" latin police officer \" . it was so funny seeing elizondo and petronius in general rodr\u00edguez 's office . they looked like two english or american students in a spanish class , making their best effort in order to pronounce spanish . unsuccessfully , of course . castulo guerra was better in his spanish . a \" peruvian \" officer , who announced cardinal sebasti\u00e1n , spoke a quite funny spanish too . there are very good peruvian actors , like augusto alvarez - calder\u00f3n and christian meier ( just to mention two out of many peruvian actors ) , who could 've performed with excellence . 6 . i admit that a fictional movie can let itself a license inventing cities or , even , countries . but , please , when creating a name , be careful when using a foreign language : the town portrayed in this movie should 've been called \" vicente \" and not \" viciente \" . vicente is a male name , and viciente has never been used . 7 . i disagree one user , who says that this movie was filmed on locations in per\u00fa . not one location is peruvian , although the production has used in excess posters showing \" inca kola \" , the peruvian soda . as not few american films , this one must have used any latin country . after all , for american producers or directors , a latin place is identical to any other latin place . 8 . in the first scenes , when john ( matthew settle ) flies to per\u00fa , he 's supposed to arrive to the only one international airport in per\u00fa : jorge ch\u00e1vez airport ( in lima , the capital ) . actually , believe me , it must be any airport in the world , but peruvian airport . and , of course , in peruvian airports there are no military or police guards . 9 . when this john takes a room in a peruvian hotel , this one has a fan and , obviously has no air conditioner . please , this does n't happen in no hotel in per\u00fa(and other latin countries ) , unless you get a 1 star hotel ! 10 . the rebels who fight against the government are ... \u00a1 colombians ! their accent was , with no doubt , from colombia . for casting them , the producers should 've hired peruvian actors . in few words , it would 've been cheaper filming in per\u00fa.<br /><br />i could go on with more examples out of this film , that led me to give it a \" 1 \" ( awful ) vote , but i fell asleep after about 20 minutes from its beginning . but dear producers : it 's not a tragedy : there are many worse movies with not few mistakes . just let 's remember \" indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull \" and indescribable disney 's \" the emperor 's new groove \" . the list of bad films could be endless ...", "label": 1}

{"text": "perhaps i would have liked this film more if i was n't so attached to the characters in henry fool . to those who 've never seen henry fool , i would n't worry . as hartley jokingly said in his introduction to the film at tiff , the film has lots of exposition and explanations.<br /><br />this film is very heavy in plot , which keeps the film moving . there are many humorous moments and the film certainly has hartley 's trademark humour and rhythm of dialogue . over all , a technically well made film and sure to satisfy new fans of hartley who are just beginning explore his work . as for the older fans who loved his earlier works like trust and amateur , this film could go either way . i have mixed feelings about the film and hartley 's later films in general . what hartley does best is setting his stories in small situations , focusing on the intimate and idiosyncratic ways in which his characters interact with each other . since his late 90s and onward , his films have widened in scope in terms of subject matter . mass media in no such thing , religion in the book of life and now terrorism in fay grim . i do n't know if hartley 's talents are suited to such big subject matter or if he 's able to do it justice.<br /><br />strangely enough , the film can still be reduced to intimate relationships , a simple love story about a woman who goes to seek out the husband she loves . the only problem is , i 've seen henry fool and everyone seems incredibly out of character in this film . you can tell this film was written long after henry fool was finished without any intention of a sequel . somehow , the terrorist plot feels conveniently tacked on through the use of henry 's books of confessions as a macguffin ( in the hitchcockian sense ) . fay 's motivations for finding henry seemed motivated purely by the needs of the plot rather than what being faithful to who fay was as person in henry fool.<br /><br />i guess i 'm slightly disappointed in the film because it 's not true to the characters in the henry fool and it does n't exactly work as a straight ahead thriller . there 's too much irony and wryness in hartley 's approach to such as big topic as terrorism . it somehow works and does n't work at the same time . all i could say , you would either love or hate the film depending on your take on hartley 's work and how well you know hartley 's work . fans of henry fool , be severely warned for a disappointment . for the rest , welcome to the world of hal hartley and enjoy the ride .", "label": 1}

{"text": "water lilies is a well - made first film from france about young female sexuality and friendship . sciamma works with specialized , slightly sanitized material that is as off - putting to some as it is alluring to others . the film focuses exclusively on three middle - class teenage girls in a tidy new paris suburb . their lives revolve around a big indoor swimming pool where two of the three are part of a synchronized water ballet team.<br /><br />such distractions as parents , siblings , work and school have been neatly excised from the equation . the central sensibility belongs to the attractively sullen but skinny marie ( pauline acquart ) , who is not on the team , but thinks she would like to be . marie worships floriane ( ad\u00e8le haenel ) , an alluring blonde and team standout whom the boys are after . this takes marie away from her former best friend , also a member of the water ballet team , the somewhat plump anne ( louise blach\u00e8re ) . being less special anne is more truly accessible to the boys . floriane , like this film , promises a bit more then she truly offers . marie has the more essential quality for a teenage girl : she suffers inwardly . flroiane does n't so much suffer as jump into situations and then bolt.<br /><br />marie is dazzled by the glamor of the water ballet as well as floriane . floriane takes advantage of this to make marie first her slave and a cover for her assignations , then , lacking any other friends , her confidante . all the other girls think floriane a slut , an illusion she encourages in the men and boys she teases , because it leads them on . she suffers the pretty girl 's fate of being not a person but an object , and she ca n't resist the validation the boys give her by wanting to kiss her and bed her , but she does n't really care about any of them and knows her involvements with them are a trap . enlisting marie to act as her pal so her ( unseen ) mother wo n't know she 's going out to meet boys , she also gets marie to rescue her from the boys later . it looked the opposite at first , but floriane needs marie as much as marie thinks she needs her . anne is left with her discomfort with her body and a desire to get laid that 's earthier and more real than the other girls'.<br /><br />keeping all external context at bay , sciamma can highlight subtle shifts in the delicate equation of the three girls ' goals and interactions . on the other hand the film 's water madness , which includes lots of showering and spitting as well as underwater swimming shots , makes it feel completely airless at times and some of its 95 minutes do not pass so quickly . luckily the film has a sense of humor and lets the trio sometimes forget their ever - present goals and avoidances and just do silly , pointless girl things . it 's the offbeat moments that give the film life ; too bad in a way that there are n't more of them . but sciamma has the courage of her obsessions and what remains as one walks out of the theater is the personalities and their dynamics . along the way of course it is pleasant to watch the swimming and to gaze at the girls , who understandably love to gaze at themselves . < br /><br />there 's no great revelation or drama on the way , but things get a bit more interesting when it emerges that marie does n't just admire but truly desires floriane and is jealous of her boyfriends -- whom floriane always stops before they go all the way . in a typical irony of this kind of plot , floriane actually decides she wants to have her first real sex with marie -- but marie is the one who holds off , because she knows it wo n't have the significance to floriane that it will have to her . when it happens , it 's a timid , mechanical affair . meanwhile anne has a huge crush on francois ( warren jacquin ) , a male swimmer , but of course he is after floriane . boys are not an element that 's been subtracted and there always seem to be several dozen ready at poolside or on the dance floor , but they are just bodies and faces , available studs .", "label": 1}

the film is heavily influenced by larry clark ( especially \" kids \" and \" bully \" ) , but clark 's films -- though also moralist and sexploitative -- are high - class masterworks compared to this crap.<br /><br />i do n't think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience 's throat : stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non - stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion -- you do get numb - minded with so much babbling , yelling , inept direction , shaky camera and terrible acting going on . stockler does n't care a bit about technique ( the quality of the images , framing , sound recording , soundtrack songs , dialog , sets , editing , etc is uniformly appalling ) , but he 's a narcissistic control - freak : he anticipates the criticisms he 's bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie / cutie comments , and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far - fetched and phony it all is ( i could relate to that ) . < br /><br />despite his megalomaniac ambitions , stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure -- he ca n't even decide if he wants gritty realism ( hand - held video camera etc ) or stylization ( repetition of scenes , use of alternate takes , etc ) . damn , he ca n't even decide where to put his camera ( there 's use of subjective camera for the three leads ) ! the dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever ; the plot exists simply to justify the director 's profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for . all you see is a filmmaker being hateful , preachy , condemning , moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent ( or technique ) to go with it.<br /><br />it 's very disappointing to find caio blat in this mess . certainly one of the most promising young film actors in brazil , with his sleepy - eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall sal mineo 's , blat can be highly effective under good direction ( as in \" carandiru \" , \" lavoura arcaica \" , \" proibido proibir \" ) . here , he 's told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under - equipped \" actors \" in recent memory . he also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes ( so goddawful they look rather like web - cam porn).<br /><br />the film opens and ends with real interviews with \" typical \" ( ? ) middle - class youth -- stockler wants us to take those interviews as \" proof \" of what he 's trying to preach in fiction . but he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees , selecting a highlight of abject , racist , sexist , stupid statements ( which only shows assholes exist everywhere ) . stockler wants to prove that brazilian middle - class youths are all present or future fascists because they 're middle - class and enjoy recreational drugs ( is he saying all neo - fascists are on drugs ? ? or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior ? ? i could n't tell ) . < br /><br />with its dogmatic self - righteousness , headache - inducing technique and mind - bending boredom , \" cama de gato \" is bad for a 1,000 reasons but , above all , it 's harmful in a very insidious manner : it gives detractors of brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument . \" cama de gato \" is best unwatched , unmentioned , buried and forgotten .", "label": 1}

{"text": "\" la furia del hombre lobo \" forms a completely stand - alone storyline which does n't seem to fit in at all with the previous waldemar daninsky movies . some have commented that this movie is supposed to take place before the events of \" werewolf shadow \" , although it was released afterwards ... they may be right , i 'm not sure . anyway , in this movie waldemar daninsky is bitten by a yeti - like creature in tibet ( great dialogue here -- \" it was a yeti . but that 's impossible . i 'm a scientist and these things do n't exist . it was a hallucination . that 's all . \" ) and although marked with the sign of the pentagram , he is able to prevent the change into a werewolf until he discovers that his wife has been cheating on him . changing into the beast one night , he kills both her and her lover before running out into a storm and being electrocuted . it 's not long before he 's resurrected by a dominatrix university professor who is conducting some kind of unfathomable experiments with mind control . he is taken to the underground cellar of a castle where the subjects of these experiments live like chained animals.<br /><br />first of all -- jacinto molina , paul naschy , whatever you want to call him , he 's a fine actor and cared passionately about his work . no matter how flawed these movies are , you can always rely on him for a decent performance . the rest of the cast seem good enough , but it 's hard to tell when they have a half - assed voice - over dubbed over all their lines . and that was really the main problem for me ... many of the voice - over artists they used were just awful , awful , awful . whenever i chuckled during the movie it was at the inept way that they delivered their lines ( they seem to constantly refer to the hero as \" waldeman \" ) . but unfortunately it 's almost impossible to find subtitled copies of naschy movies , although they 're sometimes available in the original language without subtitles.<br /><br />the directing of jose maria zabalza seems sort of hit - and - miss ... there are some great visual ideas in some scenes , while others are badly constructed and poorly edited , particularly in the final scenes when it really counts . the reason for this , was that zabalza was apparently drunk most of the time while on set . he allowed his fourteen year old nephew to rewrite molina 's dialogue , used extras without his permission , and spliced several shots from molina 's earlier movies . all of this pretty much ruined any chance this movie had of being one of molina 's best works , and it 's no surprise that the two of them never worked together again.<br /><br />but it 's not all bad news , as there are some good ideas here . some aspects of the storyline make an interesting psychological drama with the werewolf as a metaphor for jealousy and rage . the ' werewolf as a yeti ' idea is one that returned in molina 's later work . some pretty horrific and surreal stuff goes on down in the cellar , and there 's also a very memorable sequence about half way through the film where daninsky runs from house to house through a village , slaughtering or molesting innocents as he goes -- one scene is particularly intense , but it 's actually lifted straight from molina 's first movie , \" la marca del hombre - lobo \" along with a few other shots . i actually found the movie on the whole to be very entertaining , although there are some problems with the front row entertainment version , such as pretty obvious cuts ( although some of it may simply be due to the director 's lack of continuity ) . gods knows what omissions there are -- i 'll probably try to get my hands on the uncut version at some stage in the future.<br /><br />this is a overall a decent piece of vintage naschy which experienced fans might enjoy , but it could have been much better and so probably would n't make a great introduction .", "label": 1}

\" this is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies , any attempt to do something clever or different have n't worked.<br /><br />the next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats . they rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use . however , the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when michael mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary . there is a simple distinction to be made here ; mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style , roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures . i think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant.<br /><br />the best moment is reserved for robert 's comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film . those who did n't like it are generalised as ' geeks ' and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that . i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film was n't singled out for ridicule . the tirade goes further as the group joke about norwegian reviewers , complete with ' hilarious ' accents to imply that people from norway would n't know a good film simply because of where they are born . as always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting , they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant.<br /><br />the package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the sirens were cast . robert 's swears blind in voice over , ' i did n't want to make a film that was like baywatch ' as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground . there is also a simpering , self - indulgent documentary about the making of darkhunters during which robert 's says that a reviewer has claimed that forest is \" the best british film in years \" . i do n't know who he is trying to convince . at one point in the commentary track robert 's says jokingly \" i can see people sitting at home saying \" this is n't amazing , its sh$t \" he is n't wrong .", "label": 1}

{"text": "in the previews , \" the 40 year - old virgin \" boasts the image of another immature sex romp about a 40-ish lonely guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he has n't . too many past bad experiences have dampened his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women completely . and then the unexpected happens : he falls in love . what 's more , there 's a movie out about it , and it 's called \" the 40 year - old virgin . \"<br /><br />the virgin of the title is andy stitzer ( steve carell ) , who is indeed 40 , works as an employee at an electronics store and collects vintage action figures , which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see . he has a lovely home theater system and watches \" survivor \" with his two kind elderly neighbors . he 's a pretty picturesque definition of the lonely guy who needs to go out more and talk to more women.<br /><br />now here 's the real novelty with this picture : it does the impossible task of actually dealing with its subject matter in a cute , mature fashion . this is a movie that could very easily have turned out a lot differently in the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers . it could have descended into endless sex gags and jokes but thankfully this picture never stoops that low . sure there are sex jokes here and there and even a few prods are aimed at the gay community ( which are , in no way , meant to be taken as gay - bashing ) , as two of the characters exchange insults towards each other while playing a video game ( \" mortal kombat : deception , \" no less - the ultimate testosterone - driven fightfest for guys).<br /><br />as someone who is rapidly approaching 20 , collects mcfarlane toys action figures and has himself never done the deed , i found this film amusing and touching in a way that a similar - themed movie could never have been . i was able to relate to the character of andy stitzer more than anyone in the theater because i was the only teenager present at this showing ; everyone else looked like they were all past 40 . a bit arrogant , i know , but would you ( \" you \" is italicized ) still be able to relate if you were the only teen present at an afternoon screening of \" the 40 year - old virgin\"?<br /><br />of course andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with \" morning rise \" ( do n't ask ) , and he 's pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex . when it 's first discovered andy is a virgin , at 40 , his three buddies and fellow electronics store coworkers david ( paul rudd ) , jay ( romany malco ) and cal ( seth rogen ) all at first assume he 's gay because he 's never been with a woman , which could n't be any further from the truth . the truth is , andy loves women , but past traumatic experiences ( revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence ) have put him on the sidelines for good.<br /><br />david , jay , and cal each embark on a mission to get andy laid , so help them all . but you know that such escapades will only end in disaster , as proved by one date with nicky ( leslie mann ) , who puts andy through the worst drunk - driving experience i think anyone would not want to go through and he has a rather creepy encounter with beth ( elizabeth banks ) , the pretty girl who works in the bookstore and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiend.<br /><br />things brighten up for andy when he meets trish ( catherine keener ) , the friendly woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on ebay for people . hmmm . and with that nice - looking collection of action figures , you can go figure that in the end a large financial payoff awaits him , that is if he can ever \" do the deed . \"<br /><br />at last , this is the sex romp we 've been waiting for . it deals with a very real issue a lot of lonely guys probably go through , not that anything is wrong with being a virgin but let 's look at the big picture : how many of us \" lonely guys \" want to be a lonely guy forever ? the important thing we 're taught in this picture is that lonely guy must be himself . i do n't think he needs to go through body waxing like andy does ( which is side - splitting to be honest , and according to this website and various other news articles , was in fact real , and so was the blood on carell 's shirt afterward).<br /><br />\"the 40 year - old virgin \" was directed by judd apatow and co - written by himself and carell , which originated as a skit that starred carell . carell is sweet and human , as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut . this is probably one of the most intelligent romps i 've ever seen and is not offensive ( a whole lot ) because its characters are treated with dignity and respect . even carell 's buddies , who pass off bad advice to cover up their own relationship insecurities , can be related to on a fundamental level.<br /><br />the way \" the 40 year - old virgin \" plays out is indeed funny in the end , but i 'll leave that up to you , the viewer , to observe . surely , if anyone can go through the things andy does and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as catherine keener , then it 's true : it is never too late!<br /><br />10/10", "label": 1}

{"text": "yeti : curse of the snow demon starts aboard a plane full of american high school teens who are on their way to play a football game in japan , unfortunately during a fierce thunder storm their plane crashes in the himalayas . unlucky really . with some dead & some alive the survivors have to think about themselves & decide to wait it out until help comes . however just when they think their luck could n't get any worse they soon discover that a huge , hairy yeti type abominable snowman creature wants to kill & eat them all . trapped , cold , starving & fighting for survival will help reach the stranded teens in time?<br /><br />yeah , with a title like yeti : curse of the snow demon it can only mean one thing & that is that someone at the sci - fi channel has made yet another ' creature feature ' although to give these things a bit of variety the sci - fi channel here in the uk are now dubbing them as a ' beast feast ' ! as if that will make any difference . directed by paul ziller one has to say that yeti : curse of the snow deamon is a terrible film but a somewhat entertaining one at the same time , sure it 's bad but it 's sort of fun at times too . the basic premise is alright actually , it 's a sort of cross between alive ( 1993 ) with it 's plane crash & the survivors having to turn cannibal to survive & the excellent gory killer bigfoot ( another legendary hairy monster ) exploitation flick night of the demon ( 1980 ) which i would defend with my last breath & i have to say it 's not exactly a marriage made in heaven but as i said it 's fun at times if not exactly gripping or well written . the character 's are mostly annoying american teens , there 's the expected arguing , there 's the macho hero , the strong female & the coward who thinks only of himself so there 's no prizes for originality . there are some plot holes too , if a plane load of people crash why only send two rangers on foot to search for them ? how are you going to dig a large hole & line it with sharpened sticks in the space of ten minutes ? why did the yeti not kill that bird at the end ? it had killed everyone else up to that point so why not her ? the ' there are actually two yeti 's running around ' twist is n't used to any effect at all either . at least there 's a good pace about the film , it certainly moves along at a fair old pace & i never found myself becoming bored with it . there 's some moderately gory action & the film does have some fascination in seeing whether the kids are going to survive or not & if they are going to eat their dead mates or not.<br /><br />the one thing you can always say about these sci - fi channel ' creature features ' or ' beast feasts ' is that the cgi computer effects will be laugh out loud hilarious & so that proves to be the case yet again . the plane crash at the start looks awful & the yeti when it 's cgi looks simply embarrassing jumping all over the place like it 's on a pogo stick . there one or two nice gore scenes including a ripped off arm , a squashed head , a ripped out heart , some dead bodies , some blood splatter & the best bit when the yeti rips a guy in half & beats him with his own ripped - off legs before biting a big chunk out of them . according to the imdb the actor playing the yeti took three & a half hours to get into the suit & the make - up which seems like a long time since it 's actually a pretty tatty looking creation . apparently the original title was raksha : curse of the snow demon with raksha meaning demon in tibetan sanskrit , so now you know.<br /><br />this has reasonable production values considering the usual sci - fi channel stuff they churn out although the mountain location looks nothing like the harsh , bleak himalayas & was probably situated near some ski resort somewhere & during a lot of the daytime scenes it actually looks pleasantly warm . the acting is n't that good & i did n't think any of the girls looked that good either which did n't help.<br /><br />yeti : curse of the snow demon is another terrible sc - fi channel ' creature feature ' if i am honest that any sane person will not like but if your looking for a bit of horror themed fun then this is n't too bad & there are one or two entertaining moments that make it somewhat watchable even if it 's not very good .", "label": 1}
{"text": "first off , anyone looking for meaningful \" outcome oriented \" cinema that packs some sort of social message with meaningful performances and soul searching dialog spoken by dedicated , emotive , heartfelt thespians , please leave now . you are wasting your time and life is short , go see the new brangelina jolie movie , have a good cry , go out & buy a hybrid car or throw away your conflict diamonds if that will make you feel better , and leave us alone.<br /><br />don't let the door hit you on the way out either . the incredible melting man is a grade b minus regional horror epic shot in the wastelands of oklahoma by a young , tv friendly cast & crew , and concerns itself with an astronaut who is exposed to bizarre radiation effects , wakes up in a hospital , and finds that his body is liquefying on him as he sits there feeling like a chump . the melting man is played by one alex rebar , who is recognizable for about the first four minutes of the film . but once he starts oozin ' with rick baker 's extraordinary special effects makeup he more resembles something you might find in a tin of spam before you drain off all the runny , viscous blebs of grease.<br /><br />the film has zero exposition and does not bandy about with plot points : there are a couple of scenes involving scientist types riding around on an absurd industrial conveyor machine who dutifully recite a few obligatory lines about the effects of radiation but the movie does not care , really . it 's a freak show and a marvelous one at that with a decidedly sick sense of humor for those who can stomach it -- one great laugh comes when the melting man stumbles upon a young girl in the forest and is so at a loss for what to do that one of his eyes pops out . hilarious.<br /><br />the \" hero \" of the film is played by burr debenning , a fascinating character actor from the golden 1970s & 80s television scene who was sort of an early model for the kevin spacey prototype ; slightly twisted , neurotic , and one step ahead of most everyone in the room even if he looks confused . he appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for tv anthology horror piece called house of the dead ( or the alien zone ) that is regarded as one of the finest movies ever made in oklahoma , which is where i suspect this film was made as well . the arid , cold looking rural midwestern landscapes are certainly the same , and the creek that one unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport appears to be the same one that cameron mitchell fought off flying alien pancakes in without warning ... which also had a sick sense of humor , a tv friendly cast , and some pretty outrageous gore . i definitely sense at least an aesthetic connection between the three movies , as well as the silence of the lambs which is of no surprise considering that director jonathan demme is a part of melting man 's cast.<br /><br />essentially , as others have pointed out , this is a 1950s b movie plot updated for later 1970s era special effects & the inevitable boobs . the movie it probably borrows most of it 's ideas from is phantom from space with peter graves as an astronaut who also returns to earth after being exposed to funky radiation effects that set him off on a killing spree . one of the things that i actually admire about the film is that absolutely no regard is given for the melting man 's motivations : he simply goes on a rampage and the movie 's drama comes from wondering if he 's going to fall to pieces before certain characters fall victim to his madness . the budget for the film is also delightfully low and every dime spent on it is up there on the screen , rick baker 's disgusting effects getting the lion 's share of whatever was spent on this.<br /><br />sick , disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and plenty of beer . why ca n't people have made more movies like these ? < br /><br />8/10", "label": 1}

{"text": "it was the sixties , and anyone with long hair and a hip , distant attitude could get money to make a movie . that 's how michael sarne , director of this colossal flop , was able to get the job . sarne is one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie . in fact , the whole studio must have been tricked into agreeing to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film , a terribly precious 60's - hip black and white featurette called joanna . that film starred the similarly talentless actress / waif genevieve waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat - like twitter . sarne , who was probably incapable of directing a cartoon , never mind a big - budget hollywood film , was in way over his head . david giler 's book is the best place to go to find out how the faux - infant terrible sarne was able to pull the wool over everyone 's eyes . if there is ever an historical marker which indicates the superficiality and shallowness of an era , myra breckinridge provides that marker . it embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea - change in the body politic . breckinridge is a touchstone of another , equally important vein . watch this movie and you 'll get a different perspective on the less - often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years.<br /><br />many reviewers have spoken about the inter - cutting of footage from other films , especially older ones . some actually liked these clunky \" comments \" on what was taking place in the movie , others found them senseless , annoying , and obtrusive , though since the film is so bad itself any intrusion would have to be an improvement . < br /><br />in my opinion , the real reason michael sarne put so many film clips into myra brekinridge was to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed . that is to say , sarne was so imagination - challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time . they were n't inspiration , they were desperation . his writing skills were nonexistent , and david giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb , so sarne was left to actually try and make a movie , and he could n't . it was beyond his slim capabilities . hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film 's worth of clips . the ghosts of writers and directors - many long since passed on - were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because sarne sure as heck was n't able to . this was what he came up with on those days he sat on the set and thought for eight hours while the entire cast and crew ( not to mention the producers and the accountants ) cooled their heels and waited for something , some great spark of imagination , a hint of originality , a soupcon of wit , to crackle forth from the brow of zeus . um , oops . no zeus + no imagination + no sparks = millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings - each made from the hundreds of licensing agreements required to use the clips - flying out the window . bye - bye . < br /><br />as for myself , i hated the film clips . they denigrated sarne 's many betters , poked fun at people whose talents - even those whose skills were not great - far outstripped the abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration , originality - and even of plain competency - compared to even the cheesiest of them .", "label": 1}

{"text": "october sky is a highly lauded movie , and it\u00a1 \u00a6 s easy to see why . the story is easy to comprehend and many turning points are gripping , the actors and actresses do fairly good jobs , especially jake gyllenhaal and chris cooper , the hero finally gets what he wants , and it\u00a1 \u00a6 s a true story . frankly i think the director\u00a1 \u00a6 s achievement is not comparable to the sparks and heat the original story generates . we don\u00a1 \u00a6 t see any special narrative or cinematography ; the power of the movie relies much on the riveting plot and tough situation the young hero is trapped in that most audience will find themselves identify with the characters . we feel homer\u00a1 \u00a6 s desire to earn his father\u00a1 \u00a6 s recognition and create his own future , and his resilience wins our respect . \u00a1 \u00a7 october sky\u00a1\u00a8 reminds me of a later 2001 japanese production of mini series \u00a1 \u00a7 rocket boy,\u00a1\u00a8 which might owe some of the inspiration from this movie . actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison . when october sky unfolds a story of a young man crying out loud to claim his right over his own destiny , \u00a1 \u00a7 rocket boy\u00a1\u00a8 offers a more compromised description that could sometimes constitute an acrid criticism of modern society . starring the outstanding actor yuji oda , \u00a1 \u00a7 rocket boy\u00a1\u00a8 focuses on three men as ordinary as can be : a travel agent who has a dream of becoming an astronaut , a boastful advertising agent who is on the brink of being torn apart by his inferiority complex resulted from the extreme success of his father and older brother ( like what homer feels in his family ) , and a food company employee who is about to getting married but scared of this idea . the collected social consciousness superimposes its definition of success on its constituents and steps further to force them suffocate their dreams by claiming them \u00a1 \u00a7 impossible.\u00a1\u00a8 to compensate for his lost ideal , kobayashi ( yuji ) works in the tour operator because it\u00a1 \u00a6 s called \u00a1 \u00a7 galaxy.\u00a1\u00a8 when his client fails him and his girlfriend decides to leave him , he finally finds strength from his father\u00a1 \u00a6 s words , who had determined to be a sailor but later found life on the sea less attractive as he had presumed . \u00a1 \u00a7 but i don\u00a1 \u00a6 t regret it,\u00a1\u00a8 his father told kobayashi , \u00a1 \u00a7 at least i tried.\u00a1\u00a8 it is his father\u00a1 \u00a6 s confession that encourages him to resign his job and apply for astronautships despite the fact that he hurts his legs and needs to move around on a wheelchair . kobayashi\u00a1 \u00a6 s effort finally fails , and he goes back to the travel agency . but his \u00a1 \u00a7 crazy\u00a1\u00a8 courage inspires his friends , and everyone loves him more . just before the end of the series , kobayashi is on the job as a guide of a space camp meant to let children learn more about astronauts . after the tour is over we see him leaning against a tree , unfolding a sheet of poster he tears from the bulletin board that says : \u00a1 \u00a7 astronauts wanted for 2004.\u00a1\u00a8 kobayashi looks at the piece of paper and laughs and laughs , just like a kid looking at his ticket to disneyland . kobayashi may never get what he wants , but he dares his destiny and \u00a1 \u00a7 just does it.\u00a1\u00a8 this series is so heart - gripping not because the hero exhibits any heroic deeds , but his ordinariness and unstoppable urge to realize his dream which make us wonder and envy . unlike dilbert or other sarcastic writings , this show enlightens us and teaches us something . homer and kobayashi both have the dream , and they do what they can despite other people\u00a1 \u00a6 s opinions . i recommend other imdb users to see the japanese tv series . if you are a nine - to - fiver , you will feel more touched . i feel sorry that imdb doesn\u00a1 \u00a6 t have its data , maybe you can ask somebody from japan to help you .", "label": 1}

{"text": "i watched this film in youth group , where my otherwise intuitive youth leader and his wife squeed over it . then some adult couple at a church - related christmas party misled themselves into giving a copy of this movie to every single family in attendance , and now my household is stuck with the film ( though it thankfully still remains in its shrinkwrap ) . i cried bitter tears over these sad events , and here 's why : first off : this film has good intentions , especially if you 're a christian like me . this movie is trying to show that you should put your faith in god and that it 'll make your life better . not so bad , right ? eh . it turns out a be a problem -- a big one . this movie was made by a church , so of course every single issue has to be dealt with as tastefully for christians as possible . it is all black - and - white , no gray areas . god 's grace and will in this movie is a predictable thing , and it comes instantly to all those who do his bidding.<br /><br />this is not the god i know . this is not the christian life i am familiar with . the god i believe in is a powerful and trustworthy god , but he is not one that grants my every wish . i follow him as best i can , though the going is often hard ; yet the football team in this movie finds their humility and self - control a lot easier than anyone should ever find it . i can not relate to cardboard cutouts who flip from bad - side to good - side in the course of a few structured movie scenes . and when i do follow his commandments as laid out in the bible , i certainly do n't find myself showered in blessing as these characters do . the largest of my immediate rewards is knowing that i have done the right thing ; everything else comes with long , messy , arduous work.<br /><br />but take the example this movie sets : grant taylor coaches the football team at shiloh christian school , which has had 6 losing seasons in a row . he may lose his job over it , and he and his wife are low on money as it is . they want a baby , but the doctor tells him he is sterile . oh , and his car does n't work . and the boys on his football team are disrespectful to their parents , whiny after their million losses , and bad at kicking field goals . this is sure one rundown community here.<br /><br />but wait , grant taylor decides he 's going to trust in god for everything ! and he passes on his faith to his team . so far , so good . not for long . as they begin to obey , blessing literally pour in on them . suddenly the students stop disrespecting their parents ; the school has a big \" revival \" ; the team starts winning every game ; they even win the grand championship against the hardest team in the league ! coach taylor 's job is reassured ; the school gets him a shiny new truck as a present ( which , by the way , is the epitome of shallow , fair - weather employers ) ; he gets a raise ; his wife ( get this ) even gets pregnant from his sterile sperm ! and that skinny kid manages to kick his first darn field goal right when it really matters ! ! wowzers , woot , yay , praise the lord , etcetera , etcetera ! ! ! ... < br /><br />yipe . just yipe . nobody in my church has ever experienced christ in a such a cut - and - dry manner . yes , there have been miracles aplenty in my family , as well as gifts and creature comforts , and i attribute them to god 's grace and lovingkindness . but god is n't some faucet tap that you turn on and off by being good or bad ! he is by and large a mystery ; his gifts come unexpectedly , often when you think you do n't need them but you really do . it 's a long , hard slog to the road of fulfillment , and things never turn out the way you thought they would.<br /><br />this movie has good intentions . but because of its supreme shallowness and total escapism , it tanks tremendously to a 1/10 . the bad acting and sports movie clich\u00e9s seem to be mere pimples next to the leprous falsehoods that this movie inadvertently pushes.<br /><br />to all you future churches planning to make a movie : do n't be afraid to show real life , even you have to add some inconvenient truths into the mix . however much the baser populace is wowed by this cotton candy treat , nobody has learned anything substantial from it . give us the meat , the bones , the real stuff ! true life applies to everyone , not just christians , and that 's one aspect \" facing the giants \" did n't manage to grasp .", "label": 1}

( he also was attracted to all the other members of the bombshells . the roses that would appear on his bass drum had a special meaning that attested to his affection . ) well , why not see if the other band members can be located , and why not give it a shot for a reunion performance at her granddaughter 's school ? < br /><br />why not ? one member of the band is gaga . one is dead . one is in jail . one has found salvation with the salvation army . one they can find no trace of . one is last known to be in the states . one is a professional singer and has no intention of doing a school gig , even for a reunion . but one by one elizabeth and patrick bring together the surviving members of the bombshells . we do n't know if enough of them can be found . the rehearsals more often than not turn into off - key shambles . while they do this , we share elizabeth 's flashbacks of what life was like when she and patrick were young in war - time london , playing in the band while the bombs were falling . as terrible as it was , it was the most exciting time of their lives . when the night of elizabeth 's granddaughter 's dance arrives , of course , the blonde bombshells , filled with jitters and renewed friendship , blow the youngsters away . afterwards , elizabeth informs us that the bombshells are continuing to play at gigs , and that she and patrick have no plans to get married ... but see nothing wrong with a little fooling around . < br /><br />this is sentimental hogwash , expertly done , and not bad at all . what makes it work are the skill and charm of judi dench and ian holm . when i hear the term , \" warm - hearted comedy , \" i usually cringe unless the actors are first - rate . dench and holm are wonders to watch as they take something as light - weight and predictable as this script and turn it into something that charms us . then there 's the \" old broad \" gambit that 's fun if you remember the old broads . among the blonde bombshells are leslie caron , joan sims , olympia dukakis , billie whitelaw and cleo laine . laine sings three numbers and almost over - balances the production . she is so strong and unique a jazz talent that while she 's singing the program nearly becomes the cleo laine show . another attractive feature is the number of great wwii songs played in strong swing .", "label": 1}

{"text": "the movie 's storyline is pat and quaint . two women travel through the middle east and discover themselves . unfortunately , if you are looking for a movie about the middle east and central asia this is absolutely terrible.<br /><br />the producers of the film either did no research or were unbelievably lazy when filming it . to begin with , and most glaringly incorrect , the nuristanis , as they were known in the thirties , and indeed since the 1890s and their forceful conversion by abdul - rahman shah of aghnaistan , were not nomads . in fact they have not been nomads since the aryan invasions of central asia over three milenia ago.<br /><br />second , the city that is filmed as tehran is not tehran , which is understandable , however the geography of the area around the city could not be more strikingly different than the city of tehran , which is surrounded on all side by a large mountain range , which predominates all of the cities views.<br /><br />third , persian , despite the fact it is spoken in iran and afghanistan , is never heard in movie . when there are native speakers who do not speak in german they speak in arabic . the ' persian ' guards at the border , in fact , say to each other ' ma hadha rujal ' ( this is not a man ) and not ' in mard nist ' as it would be in persian . also , the love song between the indian princess and one of the main characters is obviously in spanish . while talking in the garden one of the main characters says that the quran uses the words ' ferdos ' and ' jehaan ' and makes some reference to drugs afterwords . these words certainly never appear in the quran as they are persian for paradise ( indeed , ferdos and paradise are very distant cognates between our languages ) and ' world ' respectively , though jehaan is admittedly close to ' jehennan ' which is hell in arabic . when they encounter the nomads in the desert the language spoken is also arabic , this despite the fact that there are no native speakers of arabic in iran and afghanistan and its use is primarily religious , with some use in education at that time.<br /><br />when they are stopped in iran before they reach the afghan border the people they encounter are wholly unlike any iranian group . their tents are typically bedouin with carpets decorating the walls and a high profile . in iran it is also extremely uncommon for people to wear turbans unless they are a cleric . the language spoken is clearly arabic from the initial greeting of ' ahlan wa sahlan . ' when they do reach kabul the desert they find themselves in is sandy , totally unlike the rock dirt that is found in the arid parts of the hindu kush mountain range . there is an absence of the light green scrub that covers the ground in the summer and spring . the area is also not wholly consumed by the extreme mountains of the mountain range that won its name , the indian killers , because of its difficult and limiting ground.<br /><br />in short , the story line is the only thing in this movie that holds any water and it is still weak and common place . it lacks any real draw to it , being merely the tale of two women trying to learning about themselves as they get to nuristan , however , even that is still - born and no real development is felt , leaving the characters in the end just where they were in the beginning and nothing has changed except that world war two has broken loose . in short , this is a really bad movie that i would have rated at one star except for the good footage of bedouin and the deserts of the levant , even if they are misnamed .", "label": 1}

( also , if his character was really out to destroy the japanese drug trade , he 'd have taken his client by her neck 10 minutes into the screenplay and shaken her until her teeth chattered like a castanet until she spilled her little secrets ... and a whole lot of pointless death and conflict would have been avoided . ) < br /><br />still , as a whole this movie is a long way from the bottom of the barrel . it 's still sonny chiba , and he 's still fun to watch . i paid a buck to get this off the bargain dvd rack at a local mega mart , and i feel it was worth watching once .", "label": 1}

{"text": "most complaints i 've heard of this film really come down to one thing : it is n't versus . yes , the cast and crew is basically the same . yes , kitamura rehashes a few shots in the fight scenes that come in the film 's second half , but that 's about where the similarities end . versus takes place essentially all outside , showcasing kitamura 's ability to craft an interesting b - movie in natural locations . for alive , almost everything takes place inside . in small , cramped spaces . here the art design is thrust into your face , and what art design it is ! we are treated to several very intricate and interesting spaces , and our characters are for the most part confined to those spaces . also a key difference is that we do n't get much action here until the end of the film . versus was all about action and cool , here a lot more emphasis is put on characters and situation and messing with your mind . because of this , alive is a far more interesting film than versus . you may not pop it in and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of cool zombie bloodshed , but you will sit glued to the screen for nearly two hours watching he interaction of a few genuinely interesting characters.<br /><br />i'm now ecstatic that i ordered the dvd despite some naysay . you should too ! but be sure to realize this is a different animal from versus - it 's often slow , and requires a bit of thought to get the most out of it . i hope media blasters picks it up for subtitled r1 dvd release !", "label": 1}

{"text": "while the original 1932 version , with preston foster , was good , there 's no remake more worthy than this 1959 one , or more impossible to find anywhere , just as i strongly suspect mickey rooney to have had something to do with that . never could a mere performance have ever been so masterfully brilliant , or a script more thought - provoking , as well as an improvement upon the original . many years after the last of my several viewings of this film , in 1970 , i read an article in which mickey rooney was recounting a visit he 'd made to death row , and which had apparently very drastically eliminated whatever sense of personal identification he 'd felt with people in similar circumstances . the article was about as short as the main character here , and did n't cover much , other than the extent to which his extreme disillusionment with the quality of the inmates themselves had been emphasized , even in language i would not care to explicitly quote here . . . . . one of my main problems with capital punishment is that , of course , it is not evenly , impartially applied , just as many innocent people are far - too - carelessly , thus unnecessarily sent to meet this particular fate . another problem i have with it is that it is not applied swiftly enough , or , for that matter , even publicly enough ! the bible makes a special point , in such cases , about one of the more important purposes of such , as a deterrent , being ineffectually obscured , minus , not only a public viewing , but also the direct participation of all ! as for those who claim to prove , statistically , that such is not an effective deterrent ? in addition to having a problem about the reliability of their data , i have little if any objectively disprovable doubt many are behind bars now due to the extent that such a deterrent is lacking . however , i do have a problem about the fact that robert duvall , in the apostle , had been punished at all , for his particular \" crime , \" or that the only hope of leniency for one such as he would have to be based on a \" temporary insanity \" defense , as though that would serve as the only acceptable excuse in his kind of case . . . . in addition to various other questions concerning the motives of mickey rooney for that particular visit he 'd recounted , and about the answers to which i can only try to speculate , i suspect the main one had been of a decidedly religious nature . i do n't know exactly when he 'd become the professing christian he now makes it a special point , whenever possible , to emphasize that he is ; but , as anybody should be well - aware , this particular category of people tends to be the most vehemently out for blood , when it comes to extracting an eye for an eye . however , i have no particular bone of contention concerning that , per se , just as there 's no doubt , scripturally speaking , that not all , and perhaps not even most , shall be spared the same ultimate fate , at the hands of the lord himself , as a result of his sacrifice on the cross . however , there is a problem , for me , about the spirit or attitude with which most professing christians emphasize their enthusiasm for capital punishment ; for , contrary to the lord himself , who would love to see everybody saved ( ezekiel 18:32 ) ( ii peter 3:9 ) , they seem to go vindictively out of their way to find reasons to condemn ! . . . what most people , on either side of this superlatively ever - burning issue , can not appear to sufficiently appreciate , is that the lord is as dynamically and elusively soft in nature as he is hard . the two sides of his nature appear to be so inherently incompatible as to render him mentally deranged , at least by any strictly human reckoning . yet , regardless of how harrowingly ungraspable this miraculously dynamic blending of the water and oil in his nature surely is , there can be no doubt that anything short of it , or anything fanatically and characteristically on either one side or the other of this equation , falls inadequately and unacceptably short of the entire judicial truth . indeed , i 've seen the most blood - curdling thirst for the same come out , self - contradictorily enough , on far - too - many occasions , whenever the categorically anti - death penalty advocates are confronted , even in the most rationally well - balanced ways , with the fact that , although the lord died for everybody , not all are thereby going to be saved . after - all , in order to receive absolution , one must , to repeat the same term , reach out and receive it , that is , repent ( luke 13:3 - 5 ) . could anything make more sense ? . . . but , then , what about the lord 's command to forgive , even in the case of one 's enemies , of those who despise and persecute you without a just cause or provocation ? one of the far - too - prevailing difficulties with this kind of sentimentality , as popularly misinterpreted , is the way it obscuringly over - simplifies the real meaning of forgiveness . the act of forgiveness does not , in itself , mean the same thing as unconditionally excusing the one being forgiven . when one takes a clearly sober , rationally well - balanced view here , from the perspective of god 's own attitude , all it actually amounts to is a fervent wish that the one forgiven will ultimately succeed at finding his way , seeing the light , and being granted mercy . this attitude is , of course , the very opposite of , say , that of jonah , who actually resented it when god told him that his preaching to the people of nineveh would result in their repentance . jonah did n't want them to repent , but vindictively desired that they be destroyed . how self - righteously , cold - bloodedly like unto most professing christians he was , save that even his reasons were undoubtedly better than most ! i envy jonah almost as much as he would me ! however , minus the repentance of the one being forgiven , any forgiveness he may receive from a genuine christian is not going to do him any good . in such a case , the only one to benefit is the real christian himself !", "label": 1}

to attempt to end the year on a high note . armageddon had two major gimmick matches in the last ride and inferno matches , three championships were on the line and an interesting main event in the shape of a tag team war featuring batista and john cena against king booker and finlay . however , it was an amendment to one of those championship matches that brought us not only the match of the night but also now a match of the year candidate when teddy long gave us fans an early christmas present . t - lo changed the wwe tag team championship match from champions , london and kendrick against to regal and taylor to a four team ladder match including mnm and the hardy boyz.<br /><br />i am not going to dwell on this match too much as nothing i can say would be able to do it justice . this has to be seen to be believed . there were many high spots and many more brutal bumps and awkward landings . the one move i have to talk about however was the one that took joey mercury straight to the emergency room midway through the contest . jeff hardy jumped onto a ladder that was set up in the see saw position with matt hardy holding both members of mnm over the opposite end of it to take the full force . unfortunately for mercury he did n't get his hands up to protect his face and took the ladder full force in the nose and left eye . this was vicious . his face was instantly a mess for all to see and not surprisingly this ended mercury 's night early . we found out later he suffered a broken nose and cuts under his left eye . be warned . this is not for the faint of heart . the ending to this roller - coaster of a match came after paul london managed to grab both championship belts for the victory . i have been watching wrestling for almost 15 years and it does n't get any better than this match . unbelievable.<br /><br />the night opened with only the 4th ever inferno match . kane took on mvp in a good match but it was all about the visual and not really about the action . there were a few close calls with the flames for both competitors but in the end it was kane who forced mvp onto the flames after they both ended up outside the ring . mvp ran around the ring whilst his butt was on fire and there was a sick part of me that laughed watching this . may i suggest to michael hayes that mvp comes out next week on smackdown ! to johnny cash 's ring of fire.<br /><br />the other gimmick match of the night , and the second match of a triple main event was an all out war last ride match between mr kennedy and the undertaker . this was a stiff match from start to finish and was the best of the series undertaker and kennedy have had yet . the used poles , chairs and one scene had the undertaker thrown 15 feet from the armageddon set onto what was suppose to be the concrete floor . unfortunately it was plain to see that this was nothing but a crash mat and crowd did n't pop for this . the ending came after a chokeslam by the dead man to kennedy on top of the hearse followed quickly by a match - winning tombstone.<br /><br />in other notable happening from the card . chris benoit defeated chavo guerrero by submission in another stiff match . this was a very good bout with benoit hitting 8 german suplexes on chavo at one time . benoit was also considering whether to put vikki guerrero in the sharpshooter or not . luckily he came to his senses and let her go . this led to chavo attempting the roll up only for it to be countered into the sharpshooter for the submission.<br /><br />another cracking match on the card was the cruiserweight championship contest between the longest reigning champion in wwe , gregory helms and jimmy wang yang . featuring a lot of high flying and dangerous spots , some of which took place outside the ring , this was a match much more deserving of the crowd response than what it got . jbl put it best when he berated the fans in richmond , virginia for sitting on their hands during this one and at one point even started a boring chant . helms picked up the duke after a jawbreaker type manoeuvre with his knees to smackdowns ! resident redneck.<br /><br />the boogeyman pinned the miz in a worthless match . i hate the boogeyman with a passion . only worth listening too for jbl 's ranting about miz . jbl is comedy gold.<br /><br />the last match of the night was main event number 3 . world heavyweight champion , batista and wwe champion , john cena teamed up to take on finlay and the champion of champions , king booker . there was no way the match could top the tag team championship match from earlier on but it entertained none the less . the match would have been more memorable had it been given an extra five to ten minutes but how many times have i said that about wwe matches this year already . it was king booker who was pinned at the end of the match after a big batistabomb.<br /><br />so 2006 is over for the wwe in regards to it 's pay - per - view schedule . it started the year on a terrible note with new year 's revolution but ended on a high one with armageddon . this ladder match will long be remembered as one of the greatest ladder matches of all time . my hat is off to all eight competitors who but their bodies on the line to give the fans one hell of a match .", "label": 1}

{"text": "blood legacy starts with the arrival of lawyer tom drake ( norman bartold ) to the dean estate formerly owned by the now deceased christopher dean ( john carradine ) , upon his arrival he is greeted by mr. dean 's four children , gregory ( jeff morrow ) & his wife laura ( merry anders ) , victoria ( faith domergue ) , johnny ( richard davalos ) plus leslie ( brooke mills ) & her fella carl isenberg ( john smith ) . drake plays a tape recording of they 're late father 's wishes after his death , the estate worth 136 million dollars is to be split equally between his four children , if any should die then the money would be split equally between the rest & if all were to die the freaky servants elga ( ivy bethune ) , igor ( buck kartalian ) & the more mundanely named frank ( john russell ) would pocket the lot . well , not satisfied with a quarter share of $ 136 million ( which is still almost $ 35 million back in 1971 which does n't sound too bad to me ) someone decides they want it all for themselves & it 's not long before decapitated heads are turning up in the fridge ... <br /><br />co - written , produced & directed by roy monson blood legacy disappointed me on two accounts . for starters this film 's alternate & much more common title is legacy of blood which is also the title of an obscure horror film directed by andy milliagn back in ' 78 which i 've always wanted to see , both films are regularly mixed up as both have similar stories & when i checked my on screen cable tv guide for legacy of blood i was excited because it said it was the milligan film & even listed him as director so when i actually sat down to watch it & i heard john carradine 's voice & i then knew it was n't the milligan film that i had wanted to see , my heart sank . then , of course , there 's the simple yet undeniably straight forward fact that blood legacy is a total utter piece of crap that is literally painful to watch at times . the script by monson & eric norden is slow , boring & extremely predictable . the character 's are absolutely bizarre in an annoying way , the freak of a servant who ask 's his sister ( ? ) to cane him , the strange set of brother 's & sisters who are just downright unlikeable & so far removed from reality that any tension or mystery that the simplistic whodunit story could have achieved is sorely missing & then there 's the awful twist ending that you can guess within the first 10 minutes . it 's boring to watch , it 's poorly paced & it 's just a chore to even think about it . please , someone save me as this is really bad stuff . i could go on all day about how bad blood legacy is , i really could.<br /><br />director monson was either working with a none existent budget or judging by this he should n't have even been directing traffic . the entire film looks ugly , it 's poorly photographed & there is no atmosphere or scares . the blood & gore is tame , there 's an axe in a head , a decapitated head , a scene when someone is stung to death by wasp 's & the best murder when someone 's face is eaten by piranha . however there are question marks over this scene , so there 's the victim , right . there 's the tank of piranha , right . victims head is placed in piranha tank , right . pirahna eat victims face , right . water remains crystal clear despite said victim having his face eaten , erm where 's the blood?<br /><br />technically blood legacy is terrible , it looks awful , the sound was obviously shot live & it 's muffled & hard to hear which considering the terrible dialogue is maybe a blessing in disguise . the acting was not going to win anyone any awards that 's for sure , the least said about it the better.<br /><br />blood legacy is an awful film , there really is n't a single positive aspect to it or if there is i ca n't think of it . do yourself a favour & do n't bother with this one , there are much better films out there .", "label": 1}
{"text": "first off to get my own personal feelings out of the way let me start by saying that i hate so called comedies where every single character is written and played as being so stupid that you wounder if they 're all the result of inbreeding.<br /><br />now i will say this i did see the first three american pie movies and while they were n't the most amazing movies that i 'd ever seen they were all right ( and outright masterpieces compared to the three \" american pie presents \" films ) , i still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie?<br /><br />i also have a few other questions too.<br /><br />who thought that this was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources ? < br /><br />who approved the final script ( and what was that person smoking when they approved it ) ? < br /><br />and lastly why did anyone think that it deserved to be released into theaters where the average cost of admission is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on where you live when it should have gone straight to the discount bin at blockbuster or wal mart?<br /><br />there is so much wrong with this movie that i ca n't write a really comprehensive review of it because it would exceed the maximum allowed words on this forum so i 'll just touch on the biggest things wrong with it.<br /><br />the plot is generic uninspired and stupid and characters are all about as interesting as watching paint dry for eighty minutes but the biggest thing that i can see wrong with this movie is the acting.<br /><br />while most of the cast are talentless no namers who will probably be forgotten in a few years,<br /><br />the one and only big name in this movie is eugene levy who spends almost all of the time he is on screen with this knowing smirk on his face that says to the viewer \" i know this is n't funny and i 'm wasting my talents but hey i 'm getting payed for it so who cares \" he does n't even try to make any of his jokes funny ( he really deserves better than this garbage ) . < br /><br />as i mentioned above most of the rest of the cast are horrible even though some of them have been in some really great tv shows , tyrone savage ( from the classic canadian series wind at my back ) plays a character who is so unbearable unlikeable and irritating ( there are things that he could teach to tropical skin diseases)that you almost wish he 'd die a slow and painful death on screen , christopher mcdonald ( ncis , law & order ) just hangs around on screen and wastes what talent he does have by being in this film.<br /><br />maybe the next film in this series will just be a soft core porn with a story line so they can get around the mpaa and get an r rating this movie goes all out with pointless nudity vulgarity and pointlessly offencive sexual content that it should have gotten the x rating ( the ratings board must have been drunk or on drugs when they reviewed this film for its rating ) . < br /><br />it 's interesting that twenty five years ago when wes craven submitted a nightmare on elm street to the mpaa for a rating review they forced him to cut twenty five seconds of footage ( i believe that it was part of a death scene that had a silicone casting of a breast in it ) to avoid getting an x rating and he had no other choice but to do it or the film would n't have been released , < br /><br />but this kind of needlessly offensive trash can get the r rating today because it 's all done in the name of comedy , if this movie was a drama or horror film with this kind of content there would have been a huge stink over the content and it would havegotten the dreaded x rating.<br /><br />the last thing that really annoys me is the writing , this movie is written to play out like the wet dream of some twelve year old kid with an extremely overactive sexual imagination its quite juvenile and extraordinarily crass , nearly every expository situation that is supposed to move the corpse that this movie calls a plot along is so telegraphed that any intelligent viewer can see it coming a mile away and and the so called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes , never mind the often repulsive sexual references and constant unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior it feels like this film was written by some incompetent first year hack in a low rent film school script writing class.<br /><br />the long and short of it is its time to kill this series before it gets any stupider more crass and offensive , this pie is filled with road apples .", "label": 1}
{"text": "greetings again from the darkness . what a relief ... a thriller that actually is thrilling ! new \" it \" girl rachel mcadams ( \" wedding crashers \" and \" the notebook \" ) dominates screen time in this nice little classic suspense thriller from famed horror film director wes craven ( \" scream \" movies and \" a nightmare on elm street \" ) . craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane.<br /><br />what makes this one work , is the realism of the first 15 - 20 minutes as we see mcadams interact with 4 or 5 people either in person or on the phone . she is a natural . when she meets cillian murphy ( the scarecrow in \" batman begins \" ) in what appears to be happenstance , the film really takes flight . watching the two yuppie - types flirt while the audience knows something evil is brewing , is bewitching film - making ! the plane boarding sequence is mesmerizing and the 30 plus minutes onboard is excruciatingly claustrophobic . craven keeps us guessing as to the involvement of others and if anyone will come to her rescue.<br /><br />as with many thrillers , the only letdown occurs during the climax when the lamb turns into a superhero . an interesting plot device leads us to believe little rachel has the necessary pent up frustration to see this through , but we ca n't help but cringe a bit . the most overdone scenes involve irate hotel guests , an annoying airline passenger , cillian 's injury and the fx at the hotel . the strength of the film is in the character development and psychological games between the leads . sadly the fine screen veteran brian cox is under - utilized , but overall this is an above - average suspense thriller worth seeing for all but the finale .", "label": 1}
{"text": "maybe it was the title , or the trailer ( certainly not the interview on the dvd , which is with the director as he keeps saying \" hi , kids \" into the camera like a buffoon ) , but i had expectations for entrails of a virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal , bloody killings by a weird japanese penetrator . turns out it 's way too sleazy for its own good , or bad , or whatever . there 's a problem- and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust , similar to this in many respects- in not having balance to the sex and violence . too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno , and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies ! and with the killing scenes , there has to be at least a little tack , and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity , in creating the creature / killer / whatever . entrails of a virgin has neither . it 's safe to say it 's a pretty soulless movie , even if is n't one of the very worst ever made- it 's there just for horn - dog japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their ' other ' heads.<br /><br />in this case , we 're given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls , nothing too salacious , and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by \" a murderer \" as he 's credited . first off , the director kazuo ' gaira ' komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on- we get spliced in ( or phoned in , take your pick ) clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere . it looks like it 's from another movie . then once settled into the house , there 's a ' wrestling ' scene that 's poorly choreographed and shot ( yeah , we really need to see him ' all ' there ) , and then on to the rape and killings . first the rape , by the photographers , who promise the girls some jobs for their time . then the murderer , who like d'amato 's creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial , and who for an unknown reason kills the men and/or rapes the women one by one.<br /><br />now , the latter of those , taken by themselves , should be considered the highlights of the movie . this is like saying , however , that the cro\u00fbtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad . an eye - gouging scene , a spike thrown like an olympic event ( that scene , actually , is kind of cool ) , and finally the entrailing of the overly sex - crazed girl , whose inconsequential name i ca n't remember . even * this * becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title ! on top of this , the sex scenes , which become tedious through ' gaira ' and his indulgence in long - takes - without - cutaways where everything by the japanese censors is blurred anyway , are dubbed over by the actors ( you 'd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough , hence the need to let them ' speak ' for themselves ) . but the overall feeling from entrails of a virgin is that of a lumpy one , where it 's just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror ( watch as the last girl left alive , the virgin of the picture , tries to stop the murderer from getting to her , which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him ! ) you just want it to be done with , for the ' i hate women ' mantra to ease up or be rid altogether .", "label": 1}

' still , she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life ; there 's an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve , and it primes her vulnerability . when a patient , billy hahn ( steven goldstein ) , confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers , and that they 're going to kill him if he does n't pay , she decides to intervene on his behalf . this takes her to the ` house of games , ' a seedy little dive where she meets mike ( joe mantegna ) , a charismatic con - man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world . instead of the ` twenty - five large ' that billy claimed he owed , mike shows her his book , and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars . and mike agrees to wipe the slate clean , if she 'll agree to do him one simple favor , which involves a card game he has going on in the back room . in the middle of a big hand , mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes ; while he is gone , her job is to watch for the ` tell ' of one of the other players . by this time , not only margaret , but the audience , as well , is hooked . the dialogue , and mamet 's unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines , is mesmerizing . as mike leads margaret through his compelling , surreal realm of existence , and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game , we are swept right along with her . from that first memorable encounter , when he demonstrates what a ` tell ' is and how it works , to the lessons of the ` short con , ' to the stunning climax of this film , mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless . and nothing is what it seems . in the end , margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature , and about herself . she changes ; and whether or not it 's for the better is open to speculation . mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film ; he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows , and does . crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here ; you feel the rigid , up - tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm , self - assured exterior , and when her experiences with mike induce the change in her , she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated . she makes you believe that she is capable of what she does , and makes you understand it , as well . the dynamic supporting cast includes mike nussbaum ( joey ) , lilia skala ( dr. littauer ) , j.t. walsh ( the businessman ) , ricky jay ( george ) and william h. macy ( sergeant moran ) . ` house of games ' is the quintessential mamet ; he 's written and directed a number of high - caliber plays and films since , and will no doubt grace us with more in the future . but this film will be the one that defines him ; and you can go to the dictionary and look it up . you 'll find it under ` perfection .

{"text": "there is one detail , which is not very common for jackie chan movies , but which is present here . it has some very tough and serious atmosphere about it while the funny elements are present too . jackie is menacing and psychotic here . he is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights back ( in a usual laid - back pattern ) , but he is the one who can go and start the tumult . his manner of hitting that evil guy in the glasses is amazing . every time it goes \" crack ! \" . i also especially enjoy the scene when jackie goes to the pub and thrashes the villains who had fronted on his girlfriend . it 's one of the best blitzkriegs put on screen . besides , the whole scene is shot with the background of some action character painted on the wall ( it also looks like a poster of \" rabochiy \" from our soviet era ) and some lines in russian on the left ( i noticed that quite accidentally ) . that looks terrific ( and nostalgic for russian people ) . i also like when the windows are being smashed in the movies . here there 's a lot of this stuff . it 's quite amazing watching the characters falling / jumping / running / driving through all manner of panes.<br /><br />all three movies are great . i had been preparing myself to see the down - slide of the quality but i saw a perfect trilogy with sense and incredible stunts ( and not only jackie chan 's character appears in all three movies - that 's also excellent and keeps continuity up).<br /><br />i would like to describe each movie just in a few words : no.1 - great ( in all aspects - it is one gripping story from the very beginning to the very end ) and funny ( many scenes are ridiculous ) ; no.2 - raging ( jackie is really * beep * off here ) and painful ( jackie gets tortured ) ; no.3 - unbelievable ( the woman that fights alongside with jackie is incredible ) and bombastic ( should i mention a lot of guns and explosions?).<br /><br />as to the rest - much has been mentioned by the others.<br /><br />it 's a trilogy that can be watched over and over again ( at least by me ) . its place is in top 10 among action / comedy jewels . finally it 's been released in russia on dvd ( the 2nd film has the best options - the chinese / russian soundtracks and english / russian subtitles).<br /><br />solid 10 out of 10 . thank you for attention .", "label": 1}
{"text": "no one would argue that this 1945 war film was a masterpiece . ( how could any 1945 war film be a masterpiece ? ) and yet this is an extremely effective telling of a true story , that of al schmidt , blinded on guadalcanal , as played by john garfield , who spent days wearing a blindfold to capture the nuances of a blind person 's actions . robert leckie , in \" helmet for my pillow\",denigrates schmidt 's popularity in favor of his foxhole mate , who was killed , writing that \" the country must have needed live heroes . \" < br /><br />well , i suppose the country did . and they had one here . there is a single combat scene in the movie , bound to the studio lot , lasting only ten minutes or so , and occurring less than halfway through the film instead of being saved for the climax , but it is the scariest and most realistic depiction of men under fire that i can remember having seen on screen , including those in \" saving private ryan \" . men yell with fear , scream at each other and at the enemy , and bleed and die , without the aid of color , stereophonic sound , squibs , or gore.<br /><br />simply from a technological point of view , the film is outstanding . it is n't just that we learn how complicated a mechanism a .30 caliber , water - cooled browning machine gun is , or that it must be fired in bursts of only a few rounds , or that it is n't waved around like a fire hose , as in so many other war movies . the technical precision adds to the scene 's riveting quality . the need to stick to short bursts is horrifying when dozens of shrieking enemies are pouring across a creek fifty feet away with the sole aim of exterminating you and your two isolated comrades confined to a small gun emplacement . < br /><br />the performances are solid , if not bravura , including those of the ubiquitous 1940s support , john ridgeley , and a radiant , youthful eleanor parker . the framing love story is spare , but it works , and ultimately is quite moving . a striking dream sequence is included . it 's not bunuel , but for a routine 1945 film , it stands out as original and effective . < br /><br />albert maltz may have overwritten the script , or it may have been altered by someone else . it could have used the kind of pruning that might have introduced some much needed ambiguity . still , there are odd verbal punctuations that have a surprising impact on the viewer -- \" why do n't god strike me dead ? \" and , \" in the eyes , lee . get 'em in the eyes ! \" depths of anguish in a few corny words . and a surprising amount of bitterness expressed by wounded veterans in a 1945 war film . < br /><br />notes that might seem false to a contemporary viewer but perhaps should n't : the dated vernacular which it 's difficult to believe many of today 's kids could think was actually ever spoken -- \" private gab , \" \" dope \" , \" drip , \" \" gee , \" \" you dumb coot , \" \" dame , \" \" a swell guy , \" and \" feeling sorry for yourself . \" let us consider the historical context and be kind in our judgments . at the time , some of this goofy lingo was at the cutting edge . < br /><br />real weak points ? the wounded veterans get together and argue with each other about how much of a collective future they have and the argument is oversimply resolved with a conclusion along the lines of , \" just because you have a silver plate in your head does n't mean people will think you 're a bad person . \" there are sometimes voice overs and silent prayers that are both unnecessary and downright unimaginative . \" please , god , let him return to me , \" and that sort of thing . < br /><br />well , the film makers were operating within the constraints of their times . maybe that 's why the final fade is on a shot of independence hall and the inspiring strains of \" america the beautiful \" swell in the back . < br /><br />none of this can undo the film 's virtues , which are considerable , particularly the impact of that horrifying combat scene . it 's not on television that often . if you have a chance , by all means catch it .", "label": 1}

{"text": "there can be no denying that hak se wui ( election in english ) is a well made and well thought out film . the film uses numerous clever pieces of identification all the time playing with modernity yet sticking to tradition \u0096 a theme played with throughout the film where john woo 's hong kong films are action packed and over the top in their explosive content as seen in hard boiled ( 1992 ) and when hong kong films do settle down into rhythms of telling the story from the ' bad ' point of view , they can sometimes stutter and just become merely unmemorable , a good example being city on fire ( 1987).<br /><br />election is a film that is memorable for the sheer fact of its unpredictable scenes , spontaneous action and violence that are done in a realistic and tasteful ( if that 's the right word ) manner as well as the clever little ' in pieces ' of film - making . it 's difficult to spot during the viewing but election is really constructed in a kind of three act structure : there is the first point of concern involving the actual election and whoever is voted in is voted in \u0096 not everyone likes the decision but what the uncles say , goes . the second act is the retrieving of the ancient baton from china that tradition demands must be present during the inauguration with the final third the aftermath of the inauguration and certain characters coming up with their own ideas on how the triads should and could be run . needless to say ; certain events and twists occur during each of the three thirds , some are small and immaterial whereas some are much larger and spectacular.<br /><br />election does have some faults with the majority coming in the opening third . trying to kill off time surrounding an election that only takes a few minutes to complete was clearly a hard task for the writers and filmmakers and that shows at numerous points . i got the feeling that a certain scene was just starting to go somewhere before it was interrupted by the police and then everyone gets arrested . this happens a few times : a fight breaks out in a restaurant but the police are there and everyone is arrested ; there 's a secret meeting about the baton between the triads but the police show up and everyone gets arrested ; some other triads are having a pre - election talk but the police show up and guess what ? you know.<br /><br />once the film gets out of that rut that i thought it would , it uses a sacred baton as a plot device to get everybody moving . the baton spawns some good fight scenes such as the chasing of a truck after it 's been hotwired , another chase involving a motorbike and a kung - fu fight with a load of melee weapons in a street \u0096 the scenes are unpredictable , realistic and violent but like i said , they are in a ' tasteful ' manner . where election really soars is its attention to that fine detail . when the triads are in jail , the bars are covered with wire suggesting they 're all animals in cages as that 's how they behave on the outside when in conflict . another fine piece of attention to detail is the way the uncles toast using tea and not alcohol , elevating themselves above other head gangsters who 'd use champagne ( the long good friday ) and also referencing chinese tradition of drinking tea to celebrate or commemorate.<br /><br />election is a good film that is structured well enough to enjoy and a film that has fantastic mise - en - scene as you look at what 's going on . some of the indoor settings and the clothing as well as the buckets of style that is poured on as the search and chase for the baton intensifies . the inauguration is like another short film entirely and very well integrated into the film ; hinting at chinese tradition in the process . i feel the best scene is the ending scene as it sums it up perfectly : two shifty characters fishing and debating the ruling of the triads all the while remaining realistic , unpredictable and violent : in a tasteful manner , of course .", "label": 1}

{"text": "i caught this film at the edinburgh film festival . i had n't heard much about it ; only that it was a tightly - paced thriller , shot digitally on a very low budget . i was hoping to catch the next big brit - flick . but i have to say , i was severely disappointed . \" this is not a love song \" follows two criminals , who , after accidentally shooting and killing a farmer 's young daughter , become embroiled in a deadly game of cat and mouse when the locals decide to take matters into their own hands and hunt them down.<br /><br />the real problem is that this is yet another example of style over substance in a british film . the camera angles and editing are completely at odds with the story , as are the over the top performances , and the appalling use of slow motion , which only serves to make the whole thing look like an expensive home video . there are repeated attempts to make the film look edgy and gritty , which instead come over as hilarious and over the top(cue a pathetic , obligatory drug scene , and countless , pointless camera zooms ) . no amount of cliche 's such as this can disguise the fact that this is a pretty bad story.<br /><br />we've seen this kind of thing many times before , and made a hundred times better , particularly in john boorman 's masterful \" deliverance . \" but while in the latter film , we actually cared about the characters , in this film , i found myself just wanting them to be hunted down and killed as quickly as possible . even this would n't have been so bad if their adversaries had been frightening or worthwhile , but instead , are merely a collection of stereotypical , inbred - looking countryfolk . again , another offensive , overused cliche ' coming to the fore . surely there are some nice people in the country , filmmakers?<br /><br />in its defense , \" this is not a love song \" does contain a couple of good , suspenseful moments , but it 's hard to see this film doing anything other than going straight to video , or , at a push , getting a very limited cinema release . it 's not a patch on last year 's low - budget hunted in the hills movie , \" dog soldiers \" . maybe british cinema could actually get kick - started again if the right money stopped going to the wrong people .", "label": 1}

{"text": "after the superfriends and scooby doo left the saturday morning airwaves in the fall of 1986 , i pretty much stopped watching saturday morning cartoons at that point since those were the only two that kept me tuning in . and since neither the real ghostbusters nor the flintstone kids seemed very promising to me , i \" retired \" and started sleeping in on saturday mornings . i only returned to saturday morning tv in 1988 for that one year only for one and only one animated show . < br /><br />a new animated show of superman was something i was not going to pass up . i was 17 and in high school at the time , but so what ! i loved this show . from what i can recall , this series was a gift to fans i suppose in celebration of superman 's 50th birthday that particular year . it had the theme music and the music style reminiscent of john williams movie score from the richard donner / christopher reeve superman movies . i honestly felt that the animation style ruby spears did was reminiscent of the super powers team : galactic guardians series by hanna barbera a few years before . sadly , danny dark was not back as superman , but i felt beau weaver did a very impressive job as the voice of superman and his clark kent was nerdy like the chris reeve version . after hearing him as reed richards / mr . fantastic on the 90 's fantastic four , i could still see this version of superman in my mind . ginny mcswain as lois lane . lol ! what a rhyme . she was a voice director for hanna barbera and ruby spears and i guess she took it upon herself to do lois . memories of the superfriends lingered in this series when it came to the voice over cast . jimmy olsen is mark taylor , who on the superfriends was formerly firestorm . perry white is none other than former batman tv writer stanley ralph ross , who on superfriends was gorilla grodd and brainiac in the super powers shows . and lex luthor , now a wise cracking billionaire tycoon is none other than superfriends voice alum , michael bell , whom i know best as zan and the riddler as well as many other characters on many other series . < br /><br />i felt this series was a combination of the movie superman along with the post crisis john byrne re envision of superman , with lex luthor as a billionaire tycoon , jonathan and martha kent being alive to see clark as superman . the bruce timm series and lois and clark would also do this . unfortunately , we never saw brainiac , bizarro , toyman , metallo , or darkseid . other than luthor , we saw only the prankster and we did see general zod . i especially enjoyed that one episode with wonder woman , who was voiced over by bj ward who played her on the super powers team as well . < br /><br />the episodes were smashing and i also enjoyed clark 's growing and development stories from infancy to childhood to adolescence to an adult moving to metropolis in the short little segment , superman 's family album . < br /><br />the only two things i did n't like . it only lasted one season . and after wonder woman 's guest spot , i was hoping batman would turn up voiced over by adam west ( still thinking about the super powers team episodes i guess ) . i also hoped for it because on the prankster episode , the metropolis baseball team was pitted against the gotham goliaths . < br /><br />every popular super hero has one cartoon series that is ultra rare . for spiderman , i feel it 's the 1981 solo series that aired the same time as amazing friends . for the incredible hulk , it 's the 1982 cartoon . for the fantastic four , it 's the 1978 series with herbie the robot . for batman , it 's the new adventures of batman 1977 by filmation featuring batmite . but for superman , the rarest series is this one . < br /><br />superman books and documentaries never cover or mention it . this is another series that wb should consider for dvd release . all in all , this 1988 version of superman is well .... super ! !", "label": 1}

{"text": "what starts out as a gentle country yarn , inoffensive and mildly enjoyable romantic tale changes pace as edward norton 's initially charming harlan gradually reveals more about himself and things take a turn for the sinister , as the film gradually changes from a southern romance to a modern wild western.<br /><br />an amiable rancher ( norton ) wanders into town and charms a young girl ( evan rachel wood ) , seemingly rescuing her from a dead - end existence with her bad - tempered father with a whirlwind romance , but it gradually becomes apparent that there is more to this cowboy than meets the eye.<br /><br />edward norton \u0096 a real chameleon actor ( with changing facial hair to match ) playing a country hick , accent slightly dodgy but maybe because he 's merely trying to act the part without worrying about the accent . he certainly makes it appear effortless to make all the nuanced little adjustments as we learn more about harlan . however , with too many small changes it means we are never sure exactly where harlan is coming from , and what seemed like a good performance from norton gradually becomes confused . evan rachel wood is likable without ever really having a great deal to do other than bat her eyelids at norton.<br /><br />down in the valley strikes as a slightly uneven tale due to its change of pace , and by never really making the protagonist 's motives clear the audience 's sympathies for the characters remain uncertain . should we like this drifter or not ? even after a dramatic turn of events it remains unclear . this ambiguity is to the film 's detriment , as if the writer could not make up their mind what kind of story they wanted to tell and settled for somewhat of a hotch - potch . had the film remained one or the other it might have been a solid film , but as it is what we are left with is something of a mess . fans of old - fashioned romance will enjoy a portion of the film but will be put off by the darkening tone . completist fans of norton aside ( or fans of the lush scenery of the san fernando valley ) , give this a miss .", "label": 1}
{"text": "i agree with the majority of the comments i have seen written . i grew up watching seseme street before a lot of the people who have written comments were even born . i was born in 1964 , so i was 5-yrs - old when seseme street was introduced to television . the show taught me my numbers ( the count ) , spelling ( the muppet ) , and about life . i liked all the old characters ( big bird , oscar , grover , and cookie monster ) and do n't quite understand why they had to change . i understand that everything has to change in some way , but to make cookie monster into a \" veggie monster \" to promote healthy eating . the show has introduced new characters and monsters since it 's inception , why not make a separate \" veggie monster \" that talks / discusses the benefits of eating a varied diet with cookie monster . but , back to my point . i grew up watching the very beginning of seseme street , my now 20 yr - old daughter grew up watching ss with me along side her , and we discussed mr. hooper dying , although he had died prior to her being born , as well as other topics on the show . i saw the episode as a older child , and still remember how well they portrayed the event , much like real life . and i 'm sure it hit the cast extremely hard as all deaths and losses effect families . you saw this on the show and it allowed parents and children to discuss very difficult events . the show has talked about traditional families , adoptive families and combined families . it 's one of the few shows that actually discusses these scenarios . i now have a 5 yr - old daughter who really does n't watch ss . i 've tried to watch the show a couple of times , but , it really is not what it used to be . the elmo 1/2 hr with mr. noodle is absolutely ridiculous . like many people have said , it does n't teach anything . it 's geared for the less than 18 month old ( maybe ) , and is n't even funny . i always prided myself on watching ss as a child , teen , and adult with my own child . now on my second go - round , i really have a hard time watching ss . the topics that were discussed : death , marriage , non - traditional families , new to neighborhoods , moving away were related to children and adults in a manner easy for 2 - 99 year old to understand and relate to . now , there are no concepts taught , minimal counting , only the occasional mention of the alphabet . it is not the same ss , from an original watcher of the show . please if any producers from the show read these comments , return the show to its foundation . new concepts have never been a problem with ss , they just used to have a better way to incorporate them into the show .", "label": 1}

( also agree with edyarb 's view on the end credits : leave it normal or make it cool , but not what they 've done now . ) < br /><br />ok , that gives a more negative feeling than what i actually had watching the movie . i enjoyed it ; it was pleasant entertainment for a night and definitely did n't feel like a waste of money to get the ticket . the best jokes are the ones that go a little bit outside of the expected and are fairly mature , like luke wilson 's character matt asking the super chick \" p*nis or bed ? \" when she told him she 'd \" get him a new one \" after a wild night in bed , ending up breaking the bed and leaving matt sore.<br /><br />i can not , however , agree with bgs1614,who says that the film could earn an ' r ' rating - there was absolutely nothing in the film to justify that . some sexual acts yes , but nothing explicit , only humorous , and no nudity whatsoever . ( maybe he was at a prescreening that showed more ... ? ) i 'd like to compare this to two recent films i went to see with no expectations whatsoever : superman returns and click . i did n't really expect anything from either one - i was a big fan of the original superman films and the trailer for click only showed it as a potentially chauvinistic ( which i would n't oppose ) film . superman surprised me with actually having me feel good(goosebumps ! ) about seeing his first heroic deed , like seeing a long lost friend and feeling happy about it . but for the rest of the story i 'd rather watch my super ex - girlfriend , at least it offers some surprises . click again was a total surprise , much better and deeper than the trailer and about five minutes away from being a really excellent movie . the jokes also work much better than in ex - girlfriend , both the naughty ones and the more advanced ones.<br /><br />anyway , the only reason i compared these three films is that they are the three last ones i 've seen , within a very short period , and also because i went to all of these with basically no expectations at all . i 'd rank them click , girlfriend , superman .", "label": 1}

{"text": "\" bell book and candle \" was shown recently on cable . not having seen it for a while , we decided to take another look at this comedy . based on the james van druten 's broadway hit , which was a vehicle for rex harrison and lilli palmer in the early fifties , the film was adapted for the screen by daniel taradash . the film was directed by richard quine , who turned the play into a delightful comedy.<br /><br />evidently , judging by some of the comments submitted by imdb , the big issue seems to be the pairing of the two stars , who had collaborated on \" vertigo \" , released the same year . movie audiences did n't think anything about the age difference when this film was released . in fact , most of the aging male stars of that period were always involved with much younger women.<br /><br />the film set in manhattan during christmas is a delightful comedy that has enchanted viewers . kim novak was at the height of her beauty as it 's clear the camera adored her no matter what was she playing . as the witch that becomes human , her gillian is charming . james stewart , who plays the publisher shep ' henderson , is also seen at his best . mr. stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows in here why he was at the top.<br /><br />in supporting roles the wonderful elsa lanchester , playing queenie , is a welcome addition to any movie , as she proves here . jack lemmon 's nicky holroyd , the brother of gillian , is also good . ernie kovacs is also seen as the writer sidney radlitch.<br /><br />this is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching \" bell book and candle \" .", "label": 1}

{"text": "title : zombie 3 ( 1988 ) < br /><br />directors : mostly lucio fulci , but also claudio fragasso and bruno mattei < br /><br />cast : ottaviano dellacqua , massimo vani , beatrice ring , deran serafin < br /><br />review : < br /><br />to review this flick and get some good background of it , i got ta start by the beginning . and the beginning of this is really george romeros dawn of the dead . when dawn came out in 79 , lucio fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to it and call it zombie 2 . that film is the one we know as plain ole zombie . you know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark ! ok so , after that flick ( named zombie 2 in italy ) came out and made a huge chunk of cash , the italians decided , heck . lets make some more zombie flicks ! these things are raking in the dough ! so zombie 3 was born . confused yet ? the story on this one is really just a rehash of stories we 've seen in a lot of american zombie flicks that we have seen before this one , the best comparison that comes to mind is return of the living dead . lets see ... there 's the government making experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies . canister gets released into the general population and shebang ! we get loads of zombies yearning for human flesh . a bunch of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel . they got ta fight the zombies to survive.<br /><br />there was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie . first and foremost , lucio fulci the beloved godfather of gore from italy was sick . so he could n't really finish this film the way that he wanted to . the film was then handed down to two lesser directors bruno mattei ( hell of the living dead ) and claudio fragasso ( zombie 4 ) . they did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good . you see fulci himself did n't really have his heart and soul on this flick . he was disenchanted with it . he gave the flick over to the producers and basically said : \" do whatever the hell you want with it ! \" and god love them , they did.<br /><br />and that is why ladies and gents we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great fulci credited as its \" director \" . the main problem in my opinion is that its just such a pointless bore ! there 's no substance to it whatsoever ! after the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and accidentally release it , the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters with no personality whatsoever running from the zombies . now in some cases this can prove to be fun , if # 1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and # 2 there 's a lot of gore and guts involved.<br /><br />here we get neither ! well there 's some inspired moments in there , like for example when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people . that was cool . there 's also a scene involving a flying zombie head ( wich by the way defies all logic and explanation ) and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and munching off a poor girls legs . but aside from that ... the rest of the flick just falls flat on its ass.<br /><br />endless upon endless scenes that do n't do jack to move the already non existent plot along . that was my main gripe with this flick . the sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically non - existent . i hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished ! i like my b - movies , but this one just really went even below that ! its closer to a z - level flick , if you ask me.<br /><br />the zombie make up ? pure crap . the zombies are all asian actors ( the movie was filmed in the philippines ) so you get a bunch of asian looking zombies . but that s not a big problem since they movie was set in the phillipine islands anyway . its the look of the zombies that really sucks ! they all died with the same clothes on for some reason . and what passes for zombie make up here is a bunch of black make up ( more like smudges ) on their faces . one or two zombies had slightly more complex make up , but it still was n't good enough to impress . its just a bunch of goo pointlessly splattered on the actors faces . so not only is this flick slowly paced but the zombies look like crap . these are supposed to be dead folks ! anyhows , for those expecting the usual coolness in a fulci flick do n't come expecting it here cause this is mostly somebody else 's flick . and those two involved ( mattei and fragasso ) did n't really put there heart and souls into it . in fact , when you see the extras on the dvd you will see that when fragasso is asked about his recollections and his feelings on this here flick , he does n't even take it to seriously . you can tell he is ashamed of it and in many occasions he says they \" just had a job to do and they did it \" . and that my friends , is the last nail on this flick . there 's no love , and no heart put into making this film . therefore you get a half assed , crappy zombie flick.<br /><br />only for completest or people who want to have or see every zombie flick ever made . everybody else , do n't even bother ! rating : 1 out of 5", "label": 1}

{"text": "this is one of the greatest films i have ever seen : i glowed inside throughout the whole film . the music and cinematography held the spell when little was happening on screen . the slow pace was set by the mode of travel ( a riding lawn mower with a big trailer ) and was maintained by the background sights and sounds and the slow - paced lives of the other characters.<br /><br />the story actually happened ; alvin straight died in 1996 at the age of 76 . there was no acting ; everything was completely real , as if the actors had actually transformed into the characters . sissy spacek gave a poignant performance as a somewhat disabled daughter who had suffered much but forged ahead , always wanting to do the right thing . richard farnsworth was cast perfectly and he beautifully became alvin straight , a stubborn but loving elderly man who treks across iowa to visit his estranged brother , lyle , who has had a stroke . alvin had learned much wisdom during his life and that seemed to bring out the best in the people that he encountered along the way.<br /><br />the film underscores the importance of family to this man and , hopefully , to all of us . i eagerly anticipate seeing it again , and again . directed by david lynch , this films proves his directorial skill . farnsworth was nominated for an academy award for best actor ; at 79 , he was the oldest nominee ever for that award .", "label": 1}

{"text": "first off , anyone who thinks this sequel to william friedkin 's \" the french connection \" , is superior is most definitely completely insane or moronic or both . the problem with reviewing this film is that , a. ) it 's a sequel to a brilliant movie , which always makes watching it objectively difficult , and b. ) it 's directed by john frankenhimer , one of the best american directors ever , so i wanted to like it . william friendkin was the perfect person to direct a film about drug traffic in decaying new york city , because of his documentary - like approach to the action and story , frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most stylish directors ever , i.e. \" the manchurian candidate \" and \" seconds \" , and with his \" french connection 2 \" it feels like someone trying to be gritty and not having the true understanding to pull it off . that fact that frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel by gene hackman himself really tells a lot about hackman 's understanding about the original film too . it 's well known hackman hated friedkin on the set and vowed to never work with him again , it 's also known he envisioned the character to be more one dimensional , loosing weight and trying to play him like a straight character . it shows you hackman , despite being a great actor , had no idea who to make the movie and the story great . the plot point of doyle becoming an addict is interesting , but does n't warrant the rest of the film . an unfortunate low point in frankenhimer 's filmography .", "label": 1}

{"text": "tweaked a little bit , ' nothing ' could be a children 's film . it 's a very clever concept , touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes , and goes against pretty much every hollywood convention you can think of ... what goes against everything more than , literally , \" nothing \" ? nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives . all that 's left is what they do n't hate , and a big empty white space . it 's hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film , especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot . it focuses on pretty much one subject , but that 's prime vincenzo natali territory . if you 've seen ' cube ' , you know already that he tends to like that type of situation . the \" nothing \" in this movie is apparently infinite space , but natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic , if only because there 's literally nothing else , and nowhere else to go . the actors sell it , although you can tell these guys are friends anyway . two actors from ' cube ' return here ( worth and kazan ) , but are entirely different characters . they change throughout the story , and while they 're not the strongest actors in the world , they 're at least believable.<br /><br />the reason i say this could be a children 's film under the right tweaks , is because aside from a few f - bombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence , the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be digested easily by kids . so i find it an odd choice that the writers decided to add some crass language and a small amount of gore , especially considering there is n't very much of it . this could 've gotten a pg rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue . there is very little objectionable about this film , but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it . i only say that 's a shame because not because i support censorship , but because that may have been the only thing preventing this movie from having wider exposure.<br /><br />at any rate , this is a reasonably entertaining film , albeit with a few dragged - out scenes . but for literally being about nothing , and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing , they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film .", "label": 1}

( still predictable , though . ) i saw \" gigli , \" i saw \" son of the mask \" -- and although i 'm not looking to \" smear \" this film , i can say with my own authority ( which you do n't have to agree with at all , mind you ) that i prefer both those films over this catastrophic failure.<br /><br />by the way , stone left five minutes before the movie began and people in the theater began throwing things at the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgy - type nightclub.<br /><br />\"basic instinct 2 \" -- basically , it stinks , too .", "label": 1}

{"text": "' maladolescenza ' has the air of a dark fairy tale , with its child protagonists , forest setting , and the discovery of a castle 's ruins . yet at its core , the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study of adolescents . opening with a dream sequence employing the not - so - subtle metaphor of fabrizio wrestling with his menacing hound , the film details his psychological persecution of laura , the girl who has pledged her love to him , and his eventual romance with the equally malicious sylvia . the film 's psychological complexities do give the film merit , yet there 's no doubting how unnecessarily exploitive the film is in its depiction of nudity and sex . the film 's look relies more on its gorgeous locations rather than particular cinematographic skill , and there 's no doubting the film 's greatest asset is the creepy , children 's choir - augmented soundtrack . with its odd dreamlike quality , the film is at best interesting , yet pales beside louis malle 's surreal and brilliant ' black moon ' from the same era . certainly deserving of the art versus pornography debate , for unlike many banned films , pasolini 's ' salo ' or larry clark 's ' ken park ' for instance , the film is rather unremarkable from an artistic perspective . cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock , so perhaps ' maladolescenza ' should be admired for retaining that power thirty years after its release . however shock value is the one reason alone the film is memorable . < br /><br />the film does have its defenders . yet so does nazism .", "label": 1}

{"text": "from what i 've read a lot of people were disappointed by this film , compared to part 1 . initially i could understand this but after a bit of thought i think they are wrong to be . soderbergh continues his fact based telling of che 's life that he started in part 1 . part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion . part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion . it is not soderbergh 's fault that these 2 parts of che 's life had completely different outcomes . he bravely chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way . the viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after part 1 than part 2 but that is the reality of che 's life and not in my opinion any fault of the director . the film is far from perfect . it is probably too long . at least in part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes . in part 2 they ca n't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture . che 's capture and death are dealt with well . the film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in spanish . benicio del toro is again excellent as the charismatic argentinian . so if you 've seen part 1 you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in part 2 .", "label": 1}

{"text": "i 'll admit to being biased when i reviewed this since it was my introduction to the series . i saw this film for the first time in ~2005 on the late night \" fear friday \" on amc , which often pulls obscure gems like this out of cold storage for new generations . i made it a point to watch the entire amicus anthology series before reviewing any of them here to make sure i had perspective . looking back , i still rate the house that dripped blood as my favorite , followed closely by tales from the crypt and then asylum.<br /><br />i think all of the elements that make this series charming --- the vintage ' 60s/'70s style cinematography , creepy to kooky , far - fetched tales and the utter britishness of it all right down the backing music----came together better here than any of the others overall . the movie centers around a very old english country house and the misfortune that befalls all that dwell within.<br /><br />the first story involves a horror writer and his wife , who moved into this secluded place to get a break from the city so he could concentrate on his passion . he creates a murderous character called dominic and soon starts experiencing great difficulty telling reality from fiction . there is a subtle physchedelia here via his torment that i found amusing yet creepy . oh and those horrible prop teeth ( then again these are british actors , maybe those were real ! ! ! ) < br /><br />the second story is the tale of a lonely old man ( peter cushing ) that has moved here to escape his loneliness , yet it only worsens as he is haunted by lost love . he seems to have found possible salvation at a local ( very creepy ) wax museum , but it turns out he would have been much better off alone ....... <br /><br />the third story includes the great christopher lee ( my fav british horror actor ) as a single father with a rather disturbed and thoroughly creepy young daughter . he is constantly wary of her getting into things she shouldn't --- like witchcraft ! she has a natural talent for it , with good reason . lee is superb here as the ice cold disciplinarian , that man has a true talent for playing characters that are absolutely devoid of warmth ! ! but despite his best efforts , the little troublemaker does in fact learn forbidden knowledge and bad things follow ...... <br /><br />this final story is the tale of a cynical old veteran actor that feels the young director he 's working with is n't qualified to capture a proper vampire film , right down to the quality of the costumes and his cloak in particular . so he goes to a old curiosity store in the middle of a foggy night to get something more \" authentic \" . little does he know that he picked up a truly authentic vampire 's cloak ! putting it on at the stroke of midnight has rather noticeable effects . by the time i had gotten to this fourth and final story , it was after 3 am and i could n't quite stay awake on the first try ( not from boredom ) . but i did experience something that i have hundreds of times , a curious bonding experience i have with films or music when i drift in and out of sleep and the film / music becomes part of my dream ! ! great fun ! ! this bizarre story was perfect for that and seemed much scarier the first time than it actually was because i woke up right when he was levitated by the cloak 's power and could n't quite comprehend was what happening at first . not long after , the lovely ingrid pitt , a costar on his movie set , came to visit and he warned her not to put on the cloak at midnight --- but he need n't have bothered , for she was a real vampire herself . the chintzy keyboard jingle that followed as she flew toward him on the staircase was simply hysterical ! ! and again in my half - asleep state , seemed rather confusing ! side note : make sure to catch lee and pitt along with the stunning amicus star britt ekland in the all time classic film the wicker man ( 1973 ) . < br /><br />the weakest link here was the interlacing commentary between stories , but based on the stories themselves , this is a classic ! objectively , i would say the third story is best , but i like the 4th most because it makes me smile so much . very highly recommended for horror fans and if you 're a british horror fan , it 's mandatory ! i 'd say it 's worthwhile to view the series in chronological order if you can . the last film of this series , monster club ( 1980 ) is certainly the weakest . i think the first 3 - 4 films except for the at times mediocre torture garden ( 1967 ) are the best , but if you like any of them , you should watch them all at least once . you 'll probably be back many more times to watch your favorites .", "label": 1}
{"text": "contrary to popular belief , this title , to me at least , is not so very bad . in fact . i regard it as a favoured film of all time . the welding of stories was n't structured too well when you consider the differences between the series , however despite all this , you can watch it quite happily . for a feature film of its day , the scenes are well proportioned and the characters remain consistently believable.<br /><br />the sound / audio track is a personal favourite of mine . nearly everything has a correct sound effect and many of the voices suit the characters much better than their , now badly cast us dub , counterparts . the sync is perfect in every shot . i had a few issues with the casting for the ' alien ' voices ( please forgive the crude naming , it has been a while since i 've seen it ) . otherwise however , the cast seemed perfectly balanced . i feel and believe in the characters of this movie . dubs are often a subject i rarely agree with from so long ago . i loved the osd 's from back then but the castings often let series down.<br /><br />at this point i would like to add that this was one of the first anime i saw in my life . it has historical value to me , but even after seeing the original megazone 23 it remained stronger and more watched in my collection.<br /><br />to my knowledge the title only ever made it to the us in texas . personally i think its a big shame . had the correct audience been subject to it , i think robotech the movie would have been accepted and not tarnished over the years . i am involved with anime each day of my life and everyone i have shown this movie thought it was a nicely put together title.<br /><br />watching the film after its separate components will allow the viewer to notice the evident plot holes between shows . however , without seeing the originals , a viewer would n't really notice . since the animation is identical in style , there was no reason to question it back in its day . the uk had very limited access to anime . laser discs were the most productive media . personally i like the way carl had the balls to at least push the genre . i mean harmony was n't going to put up the cash for the series to get publicised.<br /><br />despite the few picky faults people have had with this film , the eighties feel of it keeps me in love . if you watch megazone 23 now , to its original japanese audio , or the new dub , i believe you will be greatly disappointed with the osd . cast your minds back to the original bubblegum crisis dub soundtrack and imagine new eighties audio to e.v.e.<br /><br />saying all this . this film 's popularity nowadays is most likely down to its rarity on the open market . personally , it spawned a collection for me . i 'm now scouring the world for merchandise from the three components that made it up and if i ever get to meet carl macek , ill shake his hand for the effort , and buy him a pint or a crate for getting me into anime .", "label": 1}

{"text": "honestly , the concept behind \" masters of horror \" had something going for it . big - time horror directors that are now left aside by the industry being given a chance to direct horror again , i was all for it from the start . that is , until i watched some episodes ... oh boy , it 's really bad tv . not only does it seem like the directors are being given very little budgets to direct their skits , but there seems to be guidelines as well , like shooting in hd for example . to make a long story short , it 's bad both for artistic and reasons financial reasons . i can not help but compare to the \" tales from the crypt \" , and the m.o . h. episodes really do n't stand the comparison . tftc was good , moh is bad ; according to me here are a few keys to explain it : tftc was shorter ( around 25 minutes for each episode ) than moh ( 50 minutes per episode ) , i believe it allowed denser screenplays , with good ideas reoccurring more often , better overview of an episode , less chances to let the plot be confusing or boring . duration might have been also the reason why the budget was better spent on tftc : directors got to have real film music composers ( composers on moh are if inexistent , very bad ) , real actors ( whereas on moh it 's nothing but unknown actor after unknown actor ! ) , real directors of photography and , it can help sometimes , real film cameras ( while moh is shot on hd cameras with very wrongly chosen lens - pieces ) , the result of which being that the episodes of tftc looked and felt \" cinematographic \" in the sense that there was real actors being casted , ranging from michael j. fox to tim roth to kyle mclachlan to kirk douglas , but there were also film composers behind it , of the range of alan silvestri , great directors of photography like dean cundey , high - end screenplay writers , and in that sense each \" tale \" was a little movie of its own true kind . compared to tftc , the \" masters of horrors \" is quite a lame approach to tv horror . it 's very hard to stand looking at it if your standards regarding cinematography are just a little above average , because it looks the same as any ugly tv serial , if not worse . it gets boring and even annoying incredibly fast , within the first 10 minutes usually . the actors are never - heard before wannabes ( except for fairuza balk , robert englund , angela bettis and a few , but even there , they are the only famous actors of their episodes ) . the director base for moh was good in the beginning , but it 's getting worst and worst with every episode : now if even the directors are unknown to the world , what remains ? nothing ! and it 's funny how they are starting to have complete unknown directors while they have n't even had , say , stan winston , dick maas , william lustig , sam raimi , eric red , robert harmon , william friedkin , jim muro , stuart gordon , russell mulcahy ... if even \" masters of horror \" can not bring dead directors back to life , who will ? maybe a rerun of tales from the crypt will .", "label": 1}

{"text": "that word ' true ' in this film 's title got my alarm bells ringing . they rang louder when a title card referred to america 's civil war as the ' war between the states ' ( the circumlocution preferred by die - hard southerners ) . jesse james -- thief , slave - holder and murderer -- is described as a quiet , gentle farm boy.<br /><br />how dishonest is this movie ? there is no mention of slavery , far less of the documented fact that jesse james 's poor widdered mother owned slaves before the war , and that jesse and his brother frank actively fought to preserve slavery . according to this movie , all those civil war soldiers were really fighting to decide whether missouri is a northern state or a southern state ... that 's all . ( missouri : it 's a candy mint ! it 's a breath mint ! ) black people are entirely absent from this movie , except for two glimpses of a pair of beggars , one of whom wears a \" help the poor \" sign that 's very implausibly typeset instead of handwritten . ( some shots of 19th - century newspapers are inaccurate too , with 20th - century type fonts.)<br /><br />this film has a weird flashback structure . there 's some very impressive stunt riding ( and some fine work by stunt horses ) , and one excellent montage . i savoured one line of dialogue : ' some of those boys will never taste beans again . ' the movie gets a few facts straight : agnes moorehead , as jesse 's mother , conceals her right arm in the scenes following the raid by the agents of pinkerton ( here called ' remington ' ) in which jesse james 's real - life mother suffered injuries requiring the amputation of her lower arm . some errors here are pardonable : during his bushwhacking days , the real jesse james accidentally shot off part of his left middle finger , but robert wagner ( in the title role here ) does not have a stumpfinger . i 've seen a photo of jesse james 's real wife ; if she had looked half as glamorous as hope lange looks in this movie , jesse james might have stayed home more.<br /><br />there 's plenty of revisionism here , and most of the male actors wear 1950s hairstyles . but many of this movie 's errors were avoidable . jesse james 's mentor william quantrill is mentioned several times , but all the actors mispronounce his name . we see jesse and his wife moving into an elaborate two - storey house ( where he will soon die ) after paying a rent of $ 18 . actually , jesse james 's last residence ( at 1318 lafayette street , st joseph , missouri ) was a simple one - storey cottage , renting for $ 14 . there was no upper storey ... so , when jesse james is killed , his wife could not come running from upstairs as hope lange does here . ( she was actually in the kitchen.)<br /><br />one continuity error : robert wagner ( with no stunt double ) does an impressive job of taking a slug to the jaw and falling over while his hands are tied behind his back ... but when he gets up , the rope binding his wrists has vanished.<br /><br />the screenplay does some weird and unnecessary juggling of dates . following the northfield robbery attempt , jesse says he expects to get home by his birthday . the actual northfield bank raid by the james gang ( 7 september , 1876 ) was two days after jesse james 's birthday . ( maybe he meant next year 's birthday . ) later , we see jesse and his wife moving into their st joseph home on a fine summer day , while jesse tells her what he plans to do when christmas eve arrives ... but in real life , mr and mrs jesse james moved into that house on 24 december , 1881 ... so this scene should * be * on christmas eve ! these errors were entirely avoidable.<br /><br />some of the fictionalisations here do n't make sense . according to this movie , the northfield bank raid failed because one ( fictional ) henchman was late in cutting the telegraph wires . if this had actually happened , it would indeed have hampered the james gang 's getaway ... but it would n't have affected the robbery itself , which failed for other reasons.<br /><br />there are good performances here by jeffrey hunter ( as frank james ) , moorehead , alan hale jnr ( as cole younger ) and by stage actress marian seldes in a rare screen role . i was disappointed by robert wagner , normally an under - rated actor . elsewhere , wagner has proved his impressive range by convincingly portraying heroes , villains and morally ambiguous characters . here , he ca n't seem to decide whether to depict jesse james as a goodie or a baddie ... so he does n't much bother . john carradine phones in his performance in a brief role as a fictional jackleg preacher who baptises jesse and his wife at their wedding . in fact , jesse james was baptised in childhood by his uncle , a methodist minister ... but perhaps this second baptism is a topping - up.<br /><br />jesse james was no robin hood . ( i doubt that robin hood was robin hood either , but that 's another story . ) there is not one single documented instance of jesse james ever sharing his loot with anyone beyond his own family . after some of his hold - ups , he did n't even split the swag with the rest of his gang . in this movie , jesse gets gunned down right after he vows to give up his bandit ways forever . in reality , the night before his death , jesse james and the ford brothers stole horses that jesse planned to use the next day in a robbery of the platte city bank . as preparation for most of his robberies , jesse james stole horses from local farmers ... the same poor folk who ( in the inaccurate legends ) were supposedly the beneficiaries of his largesse . i cringed at one scene here , in which the fictional jesse james is so gol - durn refined that he disapproves of an oil painting which tastefully depicts nudes.<br /><br />'the true ( not much ! ) story of jesse james ' is wilfully dishonest about a thieving murderer , and likewise dishonest about the civil war . for the very impressive stunt work , one good montage and a few fine acting turns , i 'll rate this obscenely dishonest movie 2 points out of 10 .", "label": 1}

all of the aforementioned action happened in 12 minutes ! then , to add fuel to the fire , loggia somehow thinks of a way to stop the alien missile . he slowly produces a caseload of plutonium , loads it in a jeep and takes it from dc to a distant missile base to put it atop a missile . along the way , he is knocked off the road by a wild driver , breaks down and then is carjacked . he finally gets the plutonium back and drives to the base to arm the missile . again , all this in the same 63-minute time frame.<br /><br />the movie also irks the viewer by making it seem as if ottawa might be saved , only to show men , women and children get roasted . the missile is then said to have five minutes to reach new york . loggia is still driving to the base ( 4 more miles to go ) . he gets to the base and arms the missile , a two - minute countdown is then announced . all within five minutes . the boroughs of new york should have been at least scorched.<br /><br />by the way , the missile is destroyed if you have n't guessed . the abm warhead destroys it with a massive plutonium - based nuclear blast . five seconds later , the blast dissipates and all is clear . yeah , they caused a nuclear blast equivalent to 100 hiroshimas on the outskirts of new york city and nothing happens.<br /><br />the film had all the elements necessary to be a good b film , but wasted them . loggia played his character so lamely you did n't care that he sacrificed himself in the end . you did n't care about the other characters , not even the smarmy scientist played by pine . the tension that should have moved the film along just was n't physically possible in the time - line allowed ( it still would n't be today , not even with jack bauer).<br /><br />this film is very difficult to find . as far as i know , it has n't been re - issued on any medium and for good reason . i do n't know if the film meant to be or if it was standard practice , but there 's a scene where the government sends all of the best scientists , military men and businessmen into deep shelters , saying they 're too valuable to lose . there is n't a single woman or minority in the bunch . hari rhodes is the only black man in the film and he gets a brief bit playing a piano . it was worse than \" 27 days \" where an alien gives five earthlings the chance to either save or destroy the planet and he does n't include any blacks or hispanics.<br /><br />i saw this on a special sci - fi night on turner classic movies and i do n't expect it to show up again . if you do find a copy of this somewhere , you might want to put it up on amazon.com .", "label": 1}

{"text": "i am always wary of taking too instant a dislike to a film . look at it a month later and you might see it differently , or dig it up after 50 years in a different continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed at first . after sitting through the great ecstasy of robert carmichael at its uk premiere , it came as no surprise to me that i found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself . shane danielsen ( artistic director of the edinburgh international film festival ) , aided by the film 's director and producer , gave a spirited defence of a movie than received an overall negative response from the audience . edinburgh festival audiences are not easily shocked . only one person walked out in disgust . the criticisms of the film included very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor and a woman who teaches m.a. film directors . this was not an overly ' shocking ' film . there was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence , but far less extreme than many movies ( most actual weapon contact was obscured , as were aroused genitals ) . the audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring , where the acting standards were not high , where the plot was poor , predictable and drawn out , and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious film - making on the promise of a controversial movie . metaphors to the war in iraq are contrived , over - emphasised and sloppy ( apart from a general allusion to violence , any deeper meaning is unclear ) ; and the ' fig - leaf ' reference marquis de sade , as one audience member put it , seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finale.<br /><br />we have the story of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for him ( he stands out at school for his musical ability ) but takes drugs and hangs out with youths who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities extend to rape and violence . when pushed , robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside him.<br /><br />the film is not entirely without merit . the audience is left to decide how robert got that way : was it the influence of his peers ? why did all the good influences and concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in a better approach to life ? cinematically , there is a carefully - montaged scene where he hangs back ( whether through too much drugs , shyness , a latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn ? ) . several of his friends are raping a woman in a back room , partly glimpsed and framed in the centre of the screen . in the foreground of the bare bones flat , a dj is more concerned that the girl 's screams interrupt his happy house music than with any thought for the woman . ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their activities attract police attention . the stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows a rape is going on points up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way . robert slumps with his back to us in the foreground.<br /><br />but the rest of the film , including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable ( if not overly realistic ) sexual violence , is not up to this standard . some people have had a strong reaction to it ( the filmmakers ' stated intention : \" if they vomit , we have succeeded in producing a reaction \" ) but mostly - and as far as i can tell the edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from cannes - they feel , \" why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality film - making ? \" director clay hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision . his replies about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet , even his defence that there is little plot development because he did n't want to do a standard hollywood movie - all are good answers to criticisms , but unfortunately they do not apply to his film , any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone defecates , or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols . wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt , i spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening , but i found him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial . there are many truths . one aspect of art is to educate , another to entertain , another to inspire . i had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions ken loach ( one of the many great names he takes in vain ) without going so far as to admit any agenda himself . he then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell the truth . i am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a new director , or else a disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate work < br /><br />andy warhol could paint a tin of soup and it was art . clay hugh would like to emulate the great directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries . sadly , his ability at the moment only extends to making high - sounding excuses for a publicity - seeking film .", "label": 1}

{"text": "the year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of h. g. wells ' great novel , \" war of the worlds \" . this is perhaps the least well - known and very probably the best of them . no other version of wotw has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as wells wrote it , but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place : the last year of the 19th century , 1900 \u0085  using wells ' original setting , in and near woking , england.<br /><br />imdb seems unfriendly to what they regard as \" spoilers \" . that might apply with some films , where the ending might actually be a surprise , but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world , it seems positively silly . i have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in english literature , so let 's get right to the chase . the aliens are destroyed through catching an earth disease , against which they have no immunity . if that 's a spoiler , so be it ; after a book and 3 other films ( including the 1953 classic ) , you ought to know how this ends.<br /><br />this film , which follows wells ' plot in the main , is also very cleverly presented \u0096 in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late 19th / early 20th century photography . although filmed in a widescreen aspect , the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity . the general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs ( rather than black ) . colors are often reminiscent of hand - tinting . at other times , colors are washed out . these variations are typical of early films , which did n't use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality , even going from black / white to sepia / white to blue / white to reddish / white and so on \u0096 as you 'll see on occasion here . the special effects are deliberately retrograde , of a sort seen even as late as the 1920s \u0096 and yet the martians and their machines are very much as wells described them and have a more nearly realistic \" feel \" . some of effects are really awkward \u0096 such as the destruction of big ben . the acting is often more in the style of that period than ours . some aspects of victorian dress may appear odd , particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hair.<br /><br />this film is the only one that follows with some closeness wells ' original narrative \u0096 as has been noted . viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story . wells ' description of the martians \u0096 a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles \u0096 is effectively portrayed . when the martian machines appear , about an hour into the film , they too give a good impression of how wells described them . both wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the martians from the limited perspective ( primarily ) of rural england \u0096 plus a few scenes in london ( involving the narrator 's brother ) . the director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark ( big ben ) , but at least does n't dwell unduly on the devastation of london.<br /><br />the victory of the martians is hardly a surprise , despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines . the narrator , traveling about to seek escape , sees much of what wells terms \" the rout of mankind \" . he encounters a curate endowed with the victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality . they eventually find themselves on the very edge of a martian nest , where they discover an awful fact : the martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene . wells adds that after eating they set up \" a prolonged and cheerful hooting \" . the narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate \u0096 who revives just as the martians drag him off to the larder ( cheers from the gallery ; british curates are so often utterly insufferable).<br /><br />this film lasts almost 3 hours , going through wells ' story in welcome detail . it 's about time the author got his due \u0096 in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact . a word about the acting : do n't expect award - winning performances . they 're not bad , however , the actors are earnest and they grow on you . most of them , however , have had very abbreviated film careers , often only in this film . the narrator is played by hunky anthony piana , in his 2nd film . the curate is john kaufman \u0096 also in his 2nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing . the brother ( \" henderson \" ) is played with some conviction by w. bernard bauman in his first film . the artilleryman , the only other sizable part , is played by james lathrop in his first film.<br /><br />this is overall a splendid film , portraying for the first time the war of the worlds as wells wrote it . despite its slight defects , it is far and away better than any of its hyped - up competitors . if you want to see h. g. wells ' war of the worlds \u0096 and not some wholly distorted version of it \u0096 see this film !", "label": 1}

{"text": "kim ( patricia clarkson ) , george ( jake weber ) and son miles ( erik per sullivan ) are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from manhattan 's bustling metropolis . on the way , they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow . a group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along . rather than helping , at least one of the hunters , otis ( john speredakos ) , is mad because the accident cracked the buck 's antlers . george , kim and miles are disturbed by otis , and even worse , we quickly learn that otis has learned where they 're staying . meanwhile , miles is given a wendigo ( a kind of indian shape - shifting spirit / monster ) token by an indian whom only he has seen . is otis a psycho out to get our heroes ? are there wendigos in the woods ? < br /><br />i can see where wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers . it is a fairly low budget film , with technical limitations frequently showing through . much of the film , and maybe all of it , is not really about the titular creature . and perhaps the fatal blow for many people , it has a very ambiguous ending , with a number of questions left unanswered . if you are discouraged by such endings , and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant , do yourself a favor and avoid wendigo.<br /><br />personally , i like films like that . i usually prefer some ambiguity . the marketing of wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick , scary creature flick , where they 'd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end , and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for wendigo 2 : the monster returns , but that 's not what this film is . wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people . heck , writer / director larry fessenden even has a character , george , reciting robert frost . the frost poem , and george 's comment that frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things , is the key to the film.<br /><br />one of the best things about the film is its complexity . in a way , there are four different films occurring at the same time , a thread from each character . in george 's thread , he is n't exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world , and he has some parenting problems . for him , the film is a realistic , horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse . in patricia 's thread , she 's looking for rejuvenation of her life and family . she 's a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her , hoping that they 'll go away and get better . in otis ' thread , he 's even more down on his luck than george , and george 's arrival into his life symbolizes the final \" crack \" in his psychological armor . and in miles ' thread , which is probably the most important of the film , life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world . but this is a horror story , after all , albeit one with a glimmer of hope , and the events in the film give miles ' poetic interpretations a dark turn . still , when everything is said and done , he seems to be the only one retaining his composure , due to the poetic outlook.<br /><br />even though the film is low budget , there are a lot of well - executed higher budget ambitions . fessenden and director of photography terry stacey find some great shots in beautiful locations , and created some interesting slide show like montages ( such as the cards , or the indian wendigo images from the book ) . there are also interesting more traditional montages , such as miles ' nightmare . wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget films.<br /><br />other technical aspects are good for the budget . the \" wendigo \" appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous . the lighting was usually good -- there were a few times that dark scenes were n't as clear as they could have been , but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock ( it could have been digital instead ) or transfer . i thought the performances were good and far more realistic ( if you value that ) than the majority of films . although i did n't really notice the score , it must have been okay , or i would have noticed it with a negative judgment.<br /><br />overall , wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions , as long as you do n't mind having to think about the movies you watch .", "label": 1}

{"text": "a very early oliver stone ( associate-)produced film , and one of the first films in the impressive career of lloyd kaufman ( co - founder and president of the world 's only real independent film studio troma , creator of the toxic avenger and , at the prestigious amsterdam fantastic filmfestival , lifetime - achievement awarded filmmaker for over 30 years ) . having raised the money for this film on his own , lloyd wrote this script together with theodore gershuni in 1970 and in hindsight regrets having listened to advice to have gershuni else direct the film instead of doing it himself . but back then he was still inexperienced in the business and it is probably because of decisions like these that he takes no nonsense from anyone anymore . indeed it would have been interesting to see lloyd 's version of his own script - as one of the world 's most original , daring , experimental and non - compromising directors he probably would have given it even more edge than it already has . but as it is we have the gershuni - directed film . and weather it is due to the strong script , or the fact that he too is indeed quite a director of his own , sugar cookies is a very intelligent , highly suspenseful and well - crafted motion picture that deserves a lot more attention than it receives . the shoestring budget the small studio ( this was even before kaufman and his friend and partner for over 30 years now , michael herz , formed troma ) had to work with is so well handled that the film looks a lot more expensive , indeed does not have a \" low budget \" look at all . the story revolves around lesbian camilla stone ( played by enigmatic mary woronow ) and her lover who winds up dead through circumstances i wo n't reveal not to spoil a delightful story . this leads to a succession of plot - twists , mind games and personality reform that is loosely inspired by hitchcock 's vertigo and at least as inventive . the atmosphere is a lot grimmer , though , and some comparisons to nicholas roeg 's and donald cammell 's performance come to mind . in this mix is a very original and inventive erotic laden thriller that keeps it quite unclear as to how it is all going to end , which , along with a splendidly interwoven sub - plot with a nod to kaufman 's earlier and unfortunately unavailable big guss what 's the fuss , makes for a very exciting one - and - a - half - hour . certainly one of the best films in troma 's library , and yet again one of those films that defy the curious fantasy that their catalog is one of bad taste . the dvd includes some recent interviews kaufman conducts with woronov and the other leading lady lynn lowry ( later seen in george romero 's the crazies ) , thus giving some interesting insight in what went on during the making of this cult - favorite and a few hints of what would be different had lloyd directed it himself . highly recommended .", "label": 1}

{"text": "french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary , everyday suburban life . this was readily apparent with the release early in 2002 of l'emploi du temps ( time out ) , a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker 's descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job . as is the penchant of french filmmakers , many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places , giving a cinema verite feel to the story , yet l'emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage ( most notably a swiss mountain retreat ) . running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production , jacques audiard 's gritty crime caper , sur mes levres ( read my lips ) . actually , to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that . as with the earlier french release , it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them . in a paris construction firm carla , a shy , diminutive young woman sits at her desk , sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms.<br /><br />obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla 's desk to chat and drop off their half - finished styrofoam cups of coffee . partially deaf , carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome , be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend 's baby . when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load , carla fears she may lose her job . at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant ( preferably male ) as if she were at a personals agency . he should be 25 years old and clean -cut , with extensive computer and filing skills . when the agency sends over an unkempt , menacing looking young man , carla is both shocked and intrigued . they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery , where carla interviews her prospective assistant . when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison , carla initially wants nothing to do with paul , but has a change of heart and hires him on . although she is basically kind toward her helper , carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power . paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker . carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment . during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips . later , when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on , a furious carla asks paul 's help in seeking revenge on the man . from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years . the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock , most notably rear window , where carla 's lip - reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars . there is a teasing , on - again , off - again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest , but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars . that being said , what one carries away from this movie is n't so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers , although those elements are definitely there , but the pervasive view a of a modern day city ( in this case paris ) where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy , garish nightlife where sex , drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters . unlike hollywood productions , this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street , where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared . it 's hitchcock with the gloves off .", "label": 1}
{"text": "this a good episode of the new twilight zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories ( i note both of them are based on short stories ) . \" examination day \" is set in the future , year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves , huge tv - looking \" phones \" that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age ... and the examination day , a point where 12-year - olds must undergo a government - required iq test . the kid is this story , dickie jordan ( david mendenhall ) is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid , so is calm , even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades . his parents ( christopher allport and elizabeth norment ) , on the other hand , say he should n't have used his birthday wish on getting a good score , and while their reason includes that they believe he 's capable and he should have no need to worry , it 's pretty obvious they are worried . i wo n't give anything away in the ending , but i will say this - there 's a point where we get a glimpse of what 's to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject : that evening ( or another ? ) his parents ask dickie whether he 'd prefer to watch tv all night . by today 's standards , we 'd be pleased he 'd say he 'd rather read and not just because there 's nothing worth watching ... but why would his family ask this ? the flavor of what 's encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from harrison bergenon ( which i hear has n't received a great adaptation to the screen ) . i only wish they could 've provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as the obsolete man was . i found it to be better than the short story it was based on . i have n't read the one that \" a message from charity \" was based on , but would like to since it was interesting - a 16-year - ld boy , peter ( robert duncan mcneill ) is suffering a fever from unclean water , that has always been common in his massachusetts hometown ... but he is able to see through the eyes of a young puritan woman suffering the same type of fever , charity payne , ( kerry noonann ) who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him . they both recover , especially since it 's common for that to happen in 1985 , but the connection does n't go away . charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each other 's company , especially peter , who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students , even at the college he 's been staying in one place at . things take an unexpected turn , though , when charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from england as a sign of bewitchment , added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever ( not so common in 1700 ) . the two try to learn a way to save her . the ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching . both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times , through a lesson / warning that sounds like something rod sterling would 've cooked up and entertainment , make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship , love , and wisdom do a great deal . probably 3/4 of this has no theme , but somehow i think it all would have been approved by sterling 's crew .", "label": 1}

{"text": "in the same vein as natural born killers , another movie that was not so popular with critics because of its excessive violence but that i also loved , kalifornia is a movie that clearly glamorizes violence , but i like to think that it turns that around in the final act . kind of like how the basketball diaries glamorizes drugs at first , but shows the bad side by the end of the movie , which is far worse than the good side is good . david duchovny plays brian kessler , an artistic yuppie with an even more artistically yuppie girlfriend , who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for , i do n't know where , places where nudity passes for art . maybe it really does and i just do n't understand it . at any rate , brian and carrie ( duchovny and michelle forbes , who fits the role flawlessly ) , make the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites . brian , the writer , will write the book , carrie can take the pictures.<br /><br />being artistic types , brian and carrie are not quite financially prepared for such a trip , so they put out an ad for someone to share gas and travel expenses , and are contacted by early grace and adele corners ( brad pitt and juliette lewis ) . early is on parole and assigned to janitorial work at the local university by his parole officer , sees the ad on a bulletin board , and decides to leave the state for a while , violating his parole but also leaving the scene of his landlord 's murder so he wo n't have to deal with a pesky murder investigation . two birds with one stone , you know.<br /><br />the movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes , the artsy yuppies and the greasy trailer trash , without resorting to clich\u00e9s or even ending up with caricatures of either type . brian and carrie are artsy liberals , but while carrie catches on to early and adele , brian is fascinated with early 's status as an outlaw , as seen in the scene where brian shoots early 's gun . never having fired a gun before , he 's as fascinated as a little kid . while adele and carrie are back at a hotel and adele reveals such things in her childlike way as the fact that early \" broke her \" of smoking and that she 's not allowed to drink ( early does n't think women should ) , early and brian are out at the local bar . brian reacts nervously to a drunk trying to start a fight with him , and early first gives advice to brian on what to do and then steps in and dishes out a quick lesson for the guy . \" hit him , bri , it 's comin ' . \" this is one of my favorite scenes in the movie , partly because it 's so funny what early gleefully says as the guy 's friends drag him away , bloodied and battered , but also because as it is intercut with the girls back at the hotel , we learn so much all at once about the two couples , their differences , and the conflicts that are likely to come up because of them . and besides that , because brian benefited from early 's actions and carrie is appalled by what she hears from adele , it also illustrates the different way that carrie and brian react to early and adele.<br /><br />clearly , by now , you can tell that this is not your typical odd couple type of thriller , where the city folk run into the country folk and all sorts of stereotypical mayhem ensues . on one hand it seems a little too convenient that brian and carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just happen to be accompanied by a real life murderer , but on the other hand it 's a great way to counteract the glorifying of murder that is inherent within a cross - country trip designed to bring fame to murderers and their crimes . while studying the actions of past murderers , brian and carrie ultimately find themselves face to face with the very material that they are studying , and realize that murder is not as pretty or morbidly fascinating when it 's in your face as it is through disconnected studies of murders past.<br /><br />i am constantly amazed at brad pitt 's versatility as an actor . consider , for example , his roles in movies like kalifornia , 12 monkeys , fight club , and ocean 's 11 and 12 . pitt is like tom hanks in that he can change his appearance drastically or just enough to fit a given character , and is completely believable . incidentally , i tried in vain to be early grace for halloween this year , but just could n't get the hair and beard right . i even got the hat right , which initially i thought would be the hardest part.<br /><br />it 's easy to understand why a lot of people disliked kalifornia or why they think that it glorifies violence and murder , but i think that whatever glorifying it does is done with the intention of clarifying the audience 's understanding of its subject matter . a film that did n't glorify violence , at least initially , could never be as effective as kalifornia , but the movie structures it perfectly . the glorification is all embodied in brian 's and carrie 's fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened , but their realization , and ours , is embodied in the real thing , which they encounter with early and adele . the movie 's very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real .", "label": 1}

{"text": "this should be my kind of movie . even if it sucked , it still should have been right up my alley ; hell , i like \" congo , \" and \" allan quatermaine \" movies . i have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien / demon / adventure movies . let 's go over why i decided to watch this in the first place.<br /><br />1 . horror / sci - fi almost always intrigues me 2 . i 'm a big fan of archaeology , and this movie does involve a rare treasure . 3 . super - natural enemies with quality fx . 4 . christian slater and dorf i generally enjoy . 5 . tara reid is hot.<br /><br />so this movie had potential , at least in the cheese - horror section of the video store , but boy did it suck ass . the only redeeming aspects are slater and dorf , and not everyone finds them as entertaining as i do ... i mean , let 's face it , both are melodramatic . but now on to some of the many faults.<br /><br />tara reid . even though the movie as a whole is worse , reid 's performance is truly awful . we 're not just talking bad , i 'm talking about nominating tara reid for worst performance of the year . i do n't know if she is capable of acting , but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league ... completely . watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist was n't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn . i mean this is n't just bad , it is laughably bad . oh , and for those of you curious , she does n't get naked , only down to a bra in a silly , totally unnecessary love scene.<br /><br />even with reid 's performance , perhaps the movie could have worked , but the plot is what dominates , and the plot seems written by a 10 year old . i had n't realized this was a video game adaptation until after watching the dvd , otherwise i would have appreciated the stupidity in real - time . < br /><br />the storyline jumps back and forth from slater 's childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened , he has amnesia , of course . in his adult life slater was recruited by some unit 713 , a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something . slater had to leave because he was too rebellious , i guess , you never really know unless it was in one of those voice - overs i zoned out during . the movie starts with slater hunting artifacts , obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a \" chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities . \" i may have the exact quote wrong , but you get the idea.<br /><br />there is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth ( no reason given ) , experiments on children , super demon / alien - human hybrids , \" photonic \" bullets ( the demon things ca n't stand sunlight ) and , of course , slater and dorf to try to save everyone.<br /><br />jesus , i ca n't even being to wade through the clich\u00e9d elements . the script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide some depth . i mean , why is this evil scientist so damn evil ? oh right , humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race . i guess he 's infected ? how did that happen ? oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself . how the hell did that happen ? why and where did he get the super slugs ( oh yes , they use the old sci - fi stand by of parasitic aliens / demons which \" fuse \" with the spine of their host)of course , slater is , like blade , half super - slug powered , but his slug \" did n't fully fuse due to an electrical shock , \" thank god . oh , and the people with these \" fused \" spines , have no idea they 're half - alien / demon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies . yeah we get zombies.<br /><br />so lots of crap that could be entertaining , but none of it is.<br /><br />also , the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place ... at least nothing a little dynamite ca n't handle.<br /><br />not the very worst thing you 'll see , but a truly bad movie .", "label": 1}

{"text": "i have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me . most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up , show off sexy models , and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window . with that said , the bourne series has been fantastic . doug liman ushered in a new take on action by using a more cinema verite style , showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as humanly . this is not the sci - fi absurdity that was bond ( before they did an overhaul in the style of this series no less ) . there was a lot to worry for when the bourne supremacy came out . with director paul greengrass taking over , what could have been a second - hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair . the stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it . greengrass needs to be given a ton of credit for being able to keep up appearances with the latest installment , the bourne ultimatum . in what is an amazing conclusion to a top - notch trilogy , the action is brought to a new level and story and performance are never compromised.<br /><br />once again , bourne is brought into the minds of the cia by false pretenses . someone has leaked information about the treadstone upgrade called blackbriar and once bourne is located trying to converse with the newswriter who broke the story , he is assumed to be the mole . only pamela landy , she who was on the case to find him in supremacy , knows that he ca n't be the one . bourne 's motive has always been to stay clear of the government and live his life in peace . it has been the cia who keeps bringing him back into the open to wreak havoc on them . what ends up transpiring is that bourne wants to know the source as well to finally find out the truth of who he is and what made him into a killer . the film , then , becomes a chase against time and each other to find the source and see if the government can close the breach and tie off all loose ends , or if bourne can get his revenge on those who took his life from him.<br /><br />in what is probably the simplest storyline of the series , with only one chase lasting the entirety of the story , it has possibly the biggest cast of characters and turning over of loyalties to expose the corruption that has been behind the full story progression . this is not a detriment at all , however , as it allows for more fights and car chases that work in full context to the plot . admission to this film is worth it for the apartment fight , between bourne and the cia 's second asset , alone . the chase jumping through windows in madrid is cool on its own , but when they finally meet up , we get a ten minute or so fight that is as invigorating to watch as any scene you 'll see . also , rather than using a massive car chase as a climatic set piece like in the first two films , we instead get around three small scale road races , just as intense , but staggered enough to never bog the action down into monotony.<br /><br />after five years of waiting , we also find out the origin of our favorite operative with heart and feeling . by the end of the film we will find out what has been the cause of all the espionage and destruction that has taken place around him . no one could have done it better than matt damon . he has the physique and attitude to be believable in the action sequences , but also the range to pull off the moments of intelligence and cat and mouse correspondence with those against him . joan allen reprises her role with the same amount of dedication to her job , but also a bit more disenchantment for what is going on around her after how brian cox 's character , from the first two films , took matters into his own hands . needing a role in that mold , we are given a nice turn from david strathairn . like cox , he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision . with as much trying to cover up any connections to his bosses of the blackbriar program as he is trying to do his duty to his country , you can never quite gauge what he will be capable of doing . even the little guys do a wonderful job , like paddy considine as the reporter who starts the leak at the center of everything , albert finney as a man from bourne 's past and possibly key to his origin , and edgar ramirez as one of the cia 's operatives sent to take bourne out . ramirez is a nice addition to the role that has been successfully played by clive owen ( identity ) , karl urban , and martin csokas ( supremacy ) . he does n't talk much , if at all , but he has the look and robotic efficiency down pat and hopefully will get more roles to show what he can do post a nice turn in domino.<br /><br />in the end , one has to applaud paul greengrass for continuing to exceed expectations and bring this series to a conclusion that builds on the success of its predecessors rather than destroy them . his skill at the close - up hand - held look is astonishing and has the same kinetic energy as tony scott , but without quite the seizure - inducing cuts . rather than feel like over- production , his use of hand - held enhances the environment and puts you directly into the action . let 's also credit cinematographer oliver wood , who shot all three bourne films . he was able to work with both directors and work his style into a nice harmony with them .", "label": 1}

{"text": "\" kings and queen \" is a bloated french drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty - two minutes to no discernible point or purpose.<br /><br />the film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie . the first centers around nora and her struggles with various men in her life , including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live . the other story involves a young man named ismael , a violinist who finds himself placed - unfairly , he believes - in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party . after traveling along on separate tracks for awhile , these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that ismael is a former lover of nora 's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier , tragic relationship.<br /><br />with a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining , \" kings and queen \" might have been a potent , engrossing drama about modern day relationships . it certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power , and the performances are , for the most part , complex and touching . but , taken as a whole , the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that , quite frankly , it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on . even more distressing is the fact that , even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people , we really do n't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over . for instance , nora 's father , on his deathbed , writes a withering diatribe against his daughter 's character that simply does n't gibe with the woman we 've been looking at for well over two hours . nora is admittedly no mother theresa ( then , again , who is ? ) , but she certainly does n't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father . nora could be accused of being confused , indecisive , a bit self - absorbed at times , but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place ? i do n't think so.<br /><br />perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that i was unable to fathom . but my suspicion is that even writer roger bohbot and co - writer / director arnaud desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here . this is a well acted , pretentious bore of a film that takes the viewer on a long , rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises , a journey that leaves him no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning .", "label": 1}

{"text": "the mind boggles at exactly what about universal soldier merited a sequel . since the real star , dolph lundgren , would not be able to reprise his role from the original , there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write - off . bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler bill goldberg and martial arts expert michael jai white . to their credit , they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement . bill goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film , and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role . for once , his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times , and it does not get irritating . the problem from the audience 's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films . and therein lies the problem . you do not go to see a van damme film because you want serious action . you go because you want comedy , however unintentional.<br /><br />unbeknownst to many people , universal soldier was followed by two direct - to - video sequels . i have only seen the first , which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke . matt battaglia was so terrible in the role of luc deveraux that for once in his career , the sight of jean - claude van damme comes as a welcome relief . the film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct - to - video sequels , and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original . after years of investigation and explanation , the unisol project is still going ahead , with some minor modifications . for one , the new unisols are stronger and more damage - resistant than their earlier cousins . for another , all of the unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called seth . in the early parts of the film , seth exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome.<br /><br />being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes , we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut . the unisol project is on the chopping block , which essentially means that seth will be turned off . seth , somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained , decides to mobilise the unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down . his only problem is that every so often , a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown . two individuals possess the code in question . seth kills the first in short order , and those who are familiar with the plot kit that van damme 's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be . the rest of the film revolves around the unisols ' attempts to get the code out of van damme without injuring him too badly . a subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film , but it adds about as much to the story as van damme does to the profession of acting.<br /><br />the film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clich\u00e9s . when seth transplants his command module into the body of michael jai white , we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over . he goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity 's weakness(es ) . gee , seth , you mean they will not be our strong points ? all kidding aside , the short length of the film is both the film 's weakness and its strength . it leaves the action without adequate setup . in the original , we are given a very thorough explanation of the unisols , how they work , and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film . here , the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a unisol is and how they operate . at least in the original , a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice . here , one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform ( and presumably his body ) , getting up every time without stopping for breath.<br /><br />i tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner . if you can see it on the cheap , knock yourself out . this is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of mystery science theatre .", "label": 1}
